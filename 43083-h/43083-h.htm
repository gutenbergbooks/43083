<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<h2>OF THE MIDDLE TEMPLE, ESQUIRE</h2>


<p>It was a dark, dank, drizzly morning in March. A dull
mist filled all the air, and the rain drifted in a thin sheet
across the garden of the Middle Temple. Everything
looked a dull drab. Certainly it was a beastly morning.
Moreover&mdash;to add to its offences&mdash;it was Monday morning.
Arthur Lisle had always hated Monday mornings; through
childhood, school, and university they had been his inveterate
enemies&mdash;with their narrow rigorous insistence on
a return to work, with the end they put to freedom, to leisure,
to excursions in the body or in the spirit. And they were
worse now, since the work was worse, in that it was not real
work at all; it was only waiting for work, or at best a tedious
and weary preparation for work which did not come and (for
all that he could see) never would come. There was no reason
why it ever should. Even genius might starve unnoticed at
the Bar, and he was no genius. Even interest might fail to
help a man, and interest he had none. Standing with his
hands in the pockets, listlessly staring out of the window of
his cell of a room, unable to make up his mind how to employ
himself, he actually cursed his means of subsistence&mdash;the
hundred and fifty pounds a year which had led him into the
fatal ambition of being called to the Bar. "But for that
it would have been impossible for me to be such an ass," he
reflected gloomily, as he pushed back his thick reddish-brown
hair from his forehead and puckered the thin sensitive lines
of his mouth into a childish pout.</p>

<p>Henry the clerk (of whom Mr. Arthur Lisle owned an
undivided fourth share) came into the room, carrying a bundle
of papers tied with red tape. Turning round on the opening
of the door, Arthur suddenly fell prey to an emotion of extraordinary
strength and complexity; amazement, joy, excitement,
fear, all in their highest expression, struggled for
mastery over him. Had he got a Brief?</p>

<p>"Mr. Norton Ward says, will you be kind enough to protect
him in Court III, in case he's on in the Court of Appeal? It's
a very simple matter, he says; it's the Divisional Court, sir,
third in the list." Henry put the papers on the table and
went out, quite disregardful of the storm of emotion which he
had aroused. Though keenly interested in the fortunes of his
employers, he did not study their temperaments.</p>

<p>It had happened, the thing that Arthur knew he ought
always to hope for, the thing that in fact he had always
dreaded. He had not got a brief; he had to "hold" one&mdash;to
hold one for somebody else, and that at short notice&mdash;"unhouseled,
disappointed, unanealed!" That is to say,
with no time to make ready for the fearful ordeal. It was
nearly ten o'clock, at half-past he must be in court; at any
moment after that the case might come on, its two predecessors
having crumpled up, as cases constantly did in the
Divisional Court. The fell terrors of nervousness beset him,
so that he was almost sick. He dashed at the brief fiercely,
but his fingers trembled so that he could hardly untie the
tape. Still, he managed a hurried run through the papers and
got the point into his head.</p>

<p>Lance and Pretyman, <span class="smcap">jj.</span>, took their seats punctually at
ten-thirty. Arthur Lisle, who felt much interest in judges as
human beings and would often spend his time in court studying
them rather than the law they administered, was glad to
see Lance there, but feared Pretyman to the bottom of his
heart. Lance was a gentle man, of courtly manners and a
tired urbanity, but Pretyman was gruff, abrupt, terribly
anxious about saving public time, and therefore always
cutting into a man's argument with the Stand-and-deliver of
a question to which, in Pretyman's opinion, there was no
answer. It would be an awful thing if Pretyman set on him
like that! Because then he might be incapable of speech,
although he knew that he was in the right. And he believed
that his case was good. "All the worse then, if you lose it!"
said a mocking voice within him.</p>

<p>Henry had taken him over to the court and had done
everything possible for him&mdash;had told the solicitor who had
briefed Norton Ward how the matter stood and how very
safe he would be in Mr. Lisle's hands if it came to that, had
given his name to the usher so that the usher could, if necessary,
give it to the Bench, and had even introduced him to Mr.
O'Sullivan, who was on the other side, a tall and burly Irishman,
famous for defending criminals, but not credited with
knowing much law.</p>

<p>As the first two cases proceeded, Arthur read his brief
again and again, and, when he was not doing that, he read
the reported case which (in the opinion of the pupil who had
got up Norton Ward's brief and had made a note of it for
him) was decisive in his favour. All the while he was praying
that the first two cases might last a long time. They did not.
Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j.</span>, smashed the pair of them in three-quarters of
an hour. "Brown and Green" called the usher, and O'Sullivan
was on his legs&mdash;and there was no sign of Norton Ward.
Henry nodded to Arthur and left the court; he was going
to see how matters stood in the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>"This is an appeal from the West Hampstead County
Court, my lords," began Mr. O'Sullivan, "which raises a
question of some importance," and he went on in such a
fashion that Arthur hoped he was going to take a long time;
for Henry had come back, and, by a shake of his head, had
indicated that there was no present hope of Norton Ward's
arrival. Mr. O'Sullivan meant to take a decently long time;
he wanted his client to feel that he was getting his money's
worth of argument; therefore he avoided the main point
and skirmished about a good deal. Above all he avoided
that case which Norton Ward's pupil had considered decisive.
Mr. O'Sullivan knew all about the case too, and had it with
him, but he was in no hurry to get to it yet.</p>

<p>Lance, <span class="smcap">j.</span>, was leaning back, the picture of polite acquiescence
in a lot assigned to him by Providence, a position
wherein dignity was tempered by <i>ennui</i>. But Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j.</span>,
was getting restive; he was fingering his beard&mdash;he committed
the solecism of wearing a beard on the Bench; then
he picked out a book from the shelf by him, and turned over
the leaves quickly. Mr. O'Sullivan came, by a series of
flourishes, a little nearer the point. And Norton Ward did
not come; and Arthur Lisle felt no better.</p>

<p>"What about Watkins and Chichester?" demanded
Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j.</span>, with a sudden violence that made Arthur
jump.</p>

<p>"I have that case here, my lord, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't seem in a hurry to cite it, Mr. O'Sullivan. It
seems to me dead in your teeth."</p>

<p>"Let us hear the headnote, Mr. O'Sullivan," said Lance, <span class="smcap">j.</span>,
suavely.</p>

<p>Then they got to it, and Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j.</span>, and Mr. O'Sullivan
had a fine wrangle over it, worrying it up and down, one
saying that this was that case, the other that this case was not
that case, because in that case that happened and in this
case this happened, and so forth. Mr. O'Sullivan "distinguished"
valiantly, and Pretyman knocked his distinctions
into a cocked hat. Lance, <span class="smcap">j.</span>, sat on smiling in silence, till at
last he asked blandly:</p>

<p>"If we think the cases indistinguishable, Watkins and
Chichester binds us, I take it, Mr. O'Sullivan?"</p>

<p>That Mr. O'Sullivan had to admit, and on that admission
down he sat.</p>

<p>The moment had come&mdash;and Norton Ward had not. With
an actual physical effort Arthur rose to his feet; a strange
voice, which did not seem to belong to him, and sounded
quite unfamiliar, said, "My lords&mdash;&mdash;" He saw Lance and
Pretyman, <span class="smcap">jj.</span>, in the shape of a grotesque, monstrous,
two-headed giant; for the latter was leaning over to the
former, who sat listening and twice nodded his head.</p>

<p>A slip of paper was handed up to Lance, <span class="smcap">j.</span> He glanced at
it and from it to Arthur. Again that strange voice said, "My
lords&mdash;&mdash;" But Lance, <span class="smcap">j.</span>, interposed suavely, "I don't
think we need trouble you, Mr. Lisle," and he proceeded to
say that not even Mr. O'Sullivan's ingenious arguments could
enable his brother or himself to distinguish Brown and Green
from Watkins and Chichester, and therefore the appeal must
be dismissed with costs.</p>

<p>"I concur," said Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j.</span>, with contemptuous curtness;
in fact he did not say "I" at all; he merely grunted
out "Concur."</p>

<p>Of course such a thing happened often, and was quite likely
to happen; very probably Norton Ward, after glancing over
his pupil's note and at <i>Watkins v. Chichester</i>, had seen that it
might happen here and had the less scruple about entrusting
his case to hands so inexperienced. None the less, Arthur
Lisle felt that the gods had played a cruel game with him.
All that agony of apprehension, all that tension of desperate
coward's courage, endured for nothing and gone for nothing!
All to be endured and achieved again&mdash;how soon? He got
out of court he hardly knew how, and made his way hurriedly
across the Strand. He would have that wig and gown off, or
somebody else would be tapping him on the shoulder, arresting
him with the stern command to hold another brief!</p>

<p>Now, back in chambers, with the strain over, he was furious
with himself, savage and furious; that mood follows hard
on the paroxysms of the malady. He began to attribute to
it all the failures of his past life&mdash;quite unjustly, for in most
cases, though it had tortured him, he had overcome the
outward manifestation of it. He could not see his life as
liveable if it were to meet him at every turn. What made
him a prey to it? Self-consciousness, silly self-consciousness,
his wise elders had always told him. But what made people
self-conscious? Self-conceit, the same wise mentors had
added. His soul rose in a plain and sincere protest, certain
of its truth: "But I'm not conceited." "Yes, but" (he
imagined the mentors' argument now) "you really are; you
think everybody's looking at you and thinking of you."
"Well, but so they are when I'm on my legs speaking; and
beforehand I know they're going to be." The mentors did
not seem to have anything to say to that.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Norton Ward came into his room to thank
him for holding the brief; he was a man of punctilious
courtesy, as indeed he was master of most of the arts and
gifts that make for success in life. At little more than thirty
he had already a fine practice; he was on the edge of "taking
silk"; he had married well&mdash;the daughter of a peer, with a
substantial portion; he was a "prospective" candidate for
Parliament. A favourite of nature and of fortune indeed!
Moreover he was a kindly man, although a ruthlessly ambitious
one. He and Arthur had become acquainted merely
through the accident of Arthur's renting the spare room in
his chambers, when he had been called to the Bar a twelve-month
before; but the landlord had taken to his tenant and
would gladly have done him a turn.</p>

<p>"I thought the case quite plain," he said; "but I'm sorry
you were done out of your argument."</p>

<p>"I wasn't sorry," Arthur confessed, with a frankness
habitual to him.</p>

<p>"You weren't? Oh, I see! Nervous!" He laughed
gently.</p>

<p>"Beyond belief. Did you used to be?"</p>

<p>"Just at first. I soon got over it. But they say one
oughtn't to get over it. Oh, you've heard the stories about
big men, haven't you? Anyhow some men never do. Why,
I've sat behind Huntley and seen his hand tremble like our
old friend the aspen leaf&mdash;and that when he was Attorney-General!"</p>

<p>"Lord!" was Arthur's despairing comment; because a
malady which did not spare an Attorney-General must surely
be unconquerable by lesser folk.</p>

<p>"But I expect it's not quite the same sort," Norton Ward
went on, smiling. "It's rather like falling in love, I expect.
A man's excited every time he falls in love, but I don't think
it's the same sort of excitement as he suffers when he falls in
love for the first time&mdash;I mean badly."</p>

<p>Now the last word of this observation so struck Arthur
that he forgot all the earlier part of it&mdash;nay, he forgot his
malady itself, together with the truth or falsity of the parallel
Norton Ward suggested.</p>

<p>"Badly? What do you mean by falling in love
badly?"</p>

<p>"I'm not speaking with regard to morals, Lisle. I mean
severely, or utterly, or passionately, or, if you prefer, idiotically."</p>

<p>Arthur's lips puckered about his pipe-stem; it was a trick
he had.</p>

<p>"I think I should call that falling in love well, not badly,"
he observed gravely.</p>

<p>It was the gravity of the speaker, not the import of the
thing spoken, which made Norton Ward laugh again and
heartily. His was one of those temperaments&mdash;sane, practical,
concrete, equable&mdash;which regard the affairs of love as a very
subsidiary matter in real life, in the real life of any individual,
that is, for of course they possess a national and racial importance
when reduced to statistics. He did not quarrel with
the literary convention which exalted love to the highest
place&mdash;the convention made good reading and produced
exciting plays&mdash;but it did not answer to real life as he knew
it, to the stern yet delightful fight which filled his days, and
really filled his wife's too, since she was a partner wherever
she could be, and an eager encourager in all things. But
what of the great amorists who were also great men and
women? Well, how much of that too was play-acting&mdash;to
the public and to themselves? That was the question his
mind instinctively put about such cases.</p>

<p>As he looked at Arthur Lisle's slight figure and sensitive
face, he felt a compassion for him, a pitying doubt whether
so frail a vessel could live in the rough sea on which it had
embarked. Characteristically this friendly impulse expressed
itself in an invitation to dinner, which was received by Arthur
with surprise, delight, and gratitude.</p>

<p>"Of course I will, and it really is most awfully kind of
you," he said.</p>

<p>Norton Ward went off to a consultation with a smile of
mingled pity and amusement still on his lips.</p>

<p>His invitation to dinner really pleased Arthur very much,
not only as a sign of friendship, but for its own sake. He had
found his early days in London lonely&mdash;in depressing contrast
with the full social life of school and Oxford. The glowing
anticipations with which imagination had invested his coming
to the metropolis had not stood the test of experience. For
some young men family connections, or notable achievements
and high reputation, provide a ready-made place in London.
Others possessed of ample means can make a pretty good one
for themselves speedily. But Arthur's university career,
though creditable and to him delightful in the highest degree
from its teeming fulness of interests, had not been conspicuous;
he had no powerful friends, and he was very poor.
After his chambers were paid for, and his share in Henry,
and his lodgings in Bloomsbury Street, there was left not
much margin beyond the necessities of life&mdash;food, raiment,
and tobacco. The theatre, even the pit, could not be indulged
in often. He had many solitary evenings. When it was fine,
he often walked the streets; when it was wet he read&mdash;and
often stopped reading to wish that something would happen.
His vague and restless longings took no form more definite
than that&mdash;wanting something to happen. He was in London,
he was young, he was ready&mdash;and nothing happened! Consequently
an invitation to dinner was a prize in the daily lottery
of life.</p>

<p>When he got back to his 'diggings' in the evening, he
found a letter from home. His mother and sister had continued
to live on in the old house at Malvern Wells after the
death of his father, who had enjoyed a fairly good practice as
a doctor there, but dying comparatively early had left a
slender provision for his family. Mrs. Lisle preferred to be
poor, since poor she had to be, in a place where she was
already known and respected. The school too was a great
attraction; there Arthur had been educated as a day boy,
and thence had proceeded to Oxford with an exhibition, to
which he added a second from his college, thus much easing
the family finances, and indeed rendering Oxford possible.
There had been talk of his people's migrating to London and
making a home for him there, but in fact none of the three
had been zealous for the change. Mrs. Lisle was frail and
clung to her accustomed hills and breezes; Anna had her
friends, her circle, her church work, her local importance;
and Arthur was at that time too full of those glowing anticipations
of London life to press the project of a family villa
somewhere in the suburbs and a season-ticket to take him
out of town at the precise hour of the evening when town
began to be amusing.</p>

<p>For all that, he was an affectionate son and brother, and
he smiled sympathetically over Anna's home gossip. Only
the postscript made him frown rather peevishly. It ran:
"Mother wants to know whether you have called on the
Godfrey Lisles <i>yet</i>!"</p>

<p>Mother wanted to know that in pretty nearly every one
of her own and Anna's letters; hence the italics which distinguished
Anna's "yet." And the answer still had to be
in the negative. Why should he call on the Godfrey Lisles?
He knew his mother's answer; a thoroughly maternal answer
it was. Godfrey Lisle, though only a distant cousin, was the
head of the house, squire of Hilsey Manor, the old family
place, and a man of considerable wealth&mdash;altogether, in fact,
the Personage of the family. Most families have a Personage,
to them very important, though varying infinitely in significance
or insignificance to the world outside. On the whole
the Lisle Personage was above the average from the outside
point of view, and Mrs. Lisle's anxiety that her son should
pay him proper attention, and reap therefrom such advantage
as might accrue, was no more than natural.</p>

<p>But to Arthur all the reasons why he ought to call on his
cousin were reasons why he could not do it. Just as, while
Mr. O'Sullivan was arguing, his imagination was picturing
what a young fool Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j.</span>, would soon be thinking him,
so here, whenever the question of this call arose, the same
remorselessly active faculty rehearsed for him all the aspects
in which he would appear to the Godfrey Lisles&mdash;a poor
relation, a tiresome duty, a country cousin, a raw youth&mdash;Oh,
in fine and in the end, a Bore of purest quality and great
magnitude! That, and nothing else, the Godfrey Lisles
would think him.</p>

<p>Still, if his mother persisted, the thing might have to
happen. He had a vision of himself watching the Godfrey
Lisles out of their house, and then diving across the road to
deposit furtive cards with the butler. A funny vision, but
with him quite capable of turning into reality!</p>

<p>His brow cleared as he took up a second letter which
awaited him. He knew the hand:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Lisle</span>,<br />
</p>

<p> &nbsp;  &nbsp; "Do drop in to-morrow evening after dinner. We
shall be having cards and perhaps a little music. About
9.30. Do as you like about dressing.</p>

<p class="right">
"Yours sincerely, &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; <br />
"<span class="smcap">Marie Sarradet</span>."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Sarradets lived in Regent's Park&mdash;rather far from
any Underground station. "I'll dress if it's fine, and not if
it's wet," thought Arthur. The balance of profit and loss as
between paying a cab-fare on the one hand and taking the
shine out of his patent leathers on the other presented a
problem of constant difficulty in connection with his evening
gaieties.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h2>MISS SARRADET'S CIRCLE</h2>


<p>A hundred and fifty years ago or thereabouts a
certain Jacques Sarradet had migrated from his
native Lyons and opened a perfumer's shop in
Cheapside. The shop was there still, and still a Sarradet kept
it, and still it was much esteemed and frequented by City men,
who bought presents or executed commissions for their wives
and daughters there. To folk of fashion the Bond Street
branch was better known, but which was the more profitable
only the master knew. Together, at all events, they were
very profitable, and the present Mr. Clement Sarradet was a
warm man&mdash;warmer than he let the world know, or even his
own family, so far as he could keep the knowledge from them.
He had preserved his French frugality, and, although his
house in Regent's Park was comfortably and hospitably conducted,
the style in which he lived was a good deal less
sumptuous than English notions would have considered his
income to warrant. He had preserved too, in spite of mixed
marriages in the family history, something of his French air,
of the appearance of a prosperous <i>bon bourgeois</i>, with his
short thick-set figure, his round paunch, his stiff upstanding
white hair (he had married late in life and was now over sixty),
his black brows and moustache, and his cheeks where blue
and red seemed, after a tussle, to have blended harmoniously
into a subdued purple.</p>

<p>Something French, though differently French, survived
also in his cherished daughter Marie, writer of the note
already set forth, and mistress of the house in Regent's Park
since her mother's death five years ago. Here it was manner
rather than looks (she was a brunette, but not markedly);
she had a vivacity, a provocativeness, a coquetry, which in
less favoured races often marks a frivolous or unstable
character, but in the French finds no difficulty in blending
with and adorning solid good sense, sturdy business-like
qualities, and even sometimes a certain toughness of tissue
more certainly valuable than attractive.</p>

<p>The evening party to which Arthur Lisle had been bidden
was drawing to its close. They had played cards; they had
had some music; they had ended up with a couple of "topping"
comic songs from Joe Halliday, and they were still
laughing over these as they munched sandwiches and sipped,
according to sex, lemonade or whisky-and-soda. Mr. Sarradet
watched them benevolently, thinking them a very pleasant
set of young people, and admiring the way in which his
daughter exercised a pretty dominion over this little band
of chosen friends. The two girls, Mildred Quain and Amabel
Osling, openly acknowledged her leadership; the men
deferred to her, not only as the hostess (a position which she
generally occupied), but as the centre of attraction and the
deviser of pleasures, the organiser of visits to theatres and
concerts, and of their lawn-tennis at the Acton ground in the
spring and summer. But there was a touch of shrewd anxiety
in his watching. Young men were wont to aspire to more
than friendship where they found metal attractive to their
eyes. Mr. Sarradet was ambitious for his daughter.</p>

<p>"Next Monday, then, we'll all meet at His Majesty's,"
Marie announced&mdash;or commanded. She turned to Joe Halliday.
"You get the tickets. And anybody who likes can
come back here to supper afterwards."</p>

<p>"Splendid, dear!" said Amabel Osling, a dark girl with
large eyes and a rather intense manner; she wore what
might be described as an art-frock.</p>

<p>"An evening out, an evening out!" chanted Joe Halliday,
a big young fellow with a shock of light brown hair and a
manner of exuberant good-nature and heartiness.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't come," said Arthur Lisle apologetically.</p>

<p>"Why not, Mr. Lisle?" Marie's voice sounded certainly
disappointed, perhaps rather resentful.</p>

<p>"I'm dining out."</p>

<p>Sidney Barslow looked at him with a smile, in which Arthur
detected an ironical flavour. Between these two members
of the circle there was, in truth, no love lost. Barslow
resented in Arthur a superiority of breeding which all his own
vanity could not enable him to ignore. Arthur found this
handsome fellow, with his carefully sleek hair, his bold
challenging eyes, his lady-killerish airs, in the end a 'bounder'
with only a veneer of elegance; all the same he wished he
had half Barslow's easy assurance and self-confidence.</p>

<p>"Oh, Learned Counsel is dining out?" In the Sarradet
circle, being of the Bar was felt to be enough of a distinction
to warrant a little chaff. "May one ask who with? The
Lord Chancellor perhaps?"</p>

<p>They all laughed. "Presently, presently!" said Joe,
patting Arthur's head. "The lad will make his way in
society."</p>

<p>"Don't be an ass, Joe." But Arthur liked Joe as much
as he disliked Barslow, and his protest was quite free from
annoyance.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to tell us who it is, Mr. Lisle?" asked
Amabel.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't suppose you'll be any the wiser; it's the
man whose chambers I share&mdash;Norton Ward."</p>

<p>Now, as it chanced, Mildred Quain's uncle lived in the
suburban constituency which Norton Ward was 'nursing'
and was of the same political colour as the prospective candidate.
Mildred had heard the candidate speak at the opening
of a bazaar&mdash;and had seen the Honourable Mrs. Norton
Ward perform the ceremony.</p>

<p>"You are among the swells, Mr. Lisle!" said Mildred,
and proceeded to describe the extreme political and social
eminence of the Norton Wards. Arthur, who had gratefully
accepted his invitation as a human kindness, was amused
at finding it regarded as a promotion, as a cause for congratulation
and envy; he grew afraid that his mention of
it might be taken for a boast.</p>

<p>"I think it was pure charity on Norton Ward's part," he
laughed. "I expect he thought I was lonely."</p>

<p>"I dare say. He couldn't be expected to know about the
likes of us," said Barslow.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up, Sidney!" cried Joe Halliday. "Can't
Arthur go out to dinner without your permission?"</p>

<p>A sudden flush spread over Barslow's face; he glared
angrily at Joe. Mr. Sarradet had taken up the evening
paper, and noticed nothing; but all the rest were conscious
that a storm threatened the serenity of the gathering. On
a trivial occasion latent jealousies had leapt to light.</p>

<p>Marie looked round her company with a smile which included
all and betrayed no partisanship. "We'll choose
another night for His Majesty's," she said. "That's quite
simple. Then we can all go. And now shall we have one
more song before we break up? One more from you, Joe!"
As they moved towards the piano, she contrived to touch
the irate Mr. Barslow lightly on the arm, to give him an arch
glance, and to murmur&mdash;very low&mdash;the word "Silly!"
Mr. Barslow's brow cleared wonderfully.</p>

<p>She wanted no quarrel and was confident of her ability to
prevent one. If one came, she would have to be arbiter;
she would have to take sides, and that must almost certainly
mean the loss of one of her friends&mdash;either Sidney Barslow
or Arthur Lisle. She did not want to lose either, for each
had an attraction for her&mdash;an attraction not of mere solid
friendship such as bound her to Joe Halliday, but an appeal
of man to woman. Barslow's boldness, his challenge, his
powerful virility drew one side of her nature with a strong
magnet; to what was 'second-class' and tawdry in him
she was not, by birth or breeding, very sensitive herself.
On the other hand she knew that Arthur Lisle was, and
admired him because he was. Nay, in a sense she was afraid
of him because he was; if she did or said anything in his
eyes amiss&mdash;if she shewed too much favour to Sidney Barslow,
for instance&mdash;he might feel about her much as he did about
the man himself. She knew all about Barslow, and all about
what Barslow felt for and about herself; it was very familiar,
one might say inherited, ground. With regard to Arthur
Lisle all this was different; he was still, in spite of their
apparent intimacy, <i>terra incognita</i>. Though he constantly
frequented the house, though from a chance acquaintance of
her brother's he had grown into a familiar friend, though
they were fast comrades, even though she knew that he admired
her, there was so much about him which she vaguely
divined to be there, but could not value or analyse&mdash;notions,
instincts, spots of sensitiveness, to which she remained really
a stranger. How strong were they, what was their verdict
on her, what their influence on him? Would a tide of admiration
or passion sweep them all away? Or would they make
such a tide impossible, or, even if it came, dam its course
with impalpable insurmountable obstacles? In fine, would
he, in spite of any feeling for her that he might have, hold her
"out of the question"?</p>

<p>He was the last to leave that night&mdash;as he often was, for
the solitude of his lodgings had no attraction for him&mdash;and
she went with him to the door. The stars shone now over
Regent's Park, and they lingered a moment in astronomical
conversation. Then she gave him her hand, saying:</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry about Monday. But you must tell me all
about your party afterwards!"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there'll be anything to tell. Well,
Mildred Quain may be interested, because of her uncle!"</p>

<p>"I shall be interested too&mdash;though not because of my
uncle," she said with a laugh and a fleet upward glance at
him. "I consider I've introduced you to London society,
and I take a maternal interest in you, Mr. Lisle."</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'Mr. Lisle' to me? You always say
'Joe' and 'Sidney' to the others."</p>

<p>"So I do. I don't know!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, don't do it," laughed Arthur. "It makes me
jealous, you know."</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment, not now in provocation,
rather in thought, perhaps in puzzle. "It needn't do that,
anyhow," at last she said.</p>

<p>"Is it then a mark of respect?" he asked banteringly,
finding pleasure in the perplexed little frown which persisted
on her pretty face.</p>

<p>"Well, I speak of you as I feel about you, and I can't say
any more," she answered, half laughing, but protesting too
that this sort of inquisition was unfair.</p>

<p>"You shall do as you like then! What you do is always right."
He spoke affectionately and held out his hand to her again.</p>

<p>She did not give him hers. She drew back a little, blushing.
"Ah, if you really thought that!" After a pause, she said
rather sharply, "Why don't you like Sidney Barslow?"</p>

<p>"I don't exactly dislike him, but sometimes he&mdash;&mdash;" He
waved his arm, wanting a word.</p>

<p>"Grates?" she suggested briefly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Arthur with a laugh. "Just every
now and then, perhaps!"</p>

<p>She stood there a moment longer with an expression on
her face which was new to him there; she looked as if she
wanted to say something or ask him something, but did not
dare. Though her lips smiled, there was appeal, almost
timidity, in her eyes. But she turned away with no more
than "Well, good-night."</p>

<p>Scores of times in the last year-and-a-half, since he had
come to know her, he had called her "a good sort" for all the
kindness and friendship she had shewn him; he had conceived
for her, and her clever capable ways, an amused admiration.
After these feelings there had grown up in him, by familiarity,
a sort of mental friendship for her face and figure too. He
never reckoned her beautiful or even very pretty, but she
had a piquancy of face and a grace of figure which had gradually
become very pleasant to him. That she was physically
attractive had been an after-thought, but, when once it had
come, it stayed. To-night he was particularly conscious of
it, perhaps because of the air of timidity or self-distrust which
softened her, and, softening her, flattered in him the latent
masculine pride.</p>

<p>Though not entirely, he had been to a large extent free
from boyish flirtations and philandering. The necessity of
hard work, shyness and fastidiousness, bodily temperament,
had all combined to keep him out of such things. One
passion of a glorious Oxford summer term he had counted the
real thing and remembered even now with a tender exultation;
for the girl's heart had been touched, though not to
the point of defying either prudence or propriety&mdash;even had
he ventured to urge such courses. Save for this episode, now
remote since such age quickly, he was in essence a stranger
in the field of love. He did not recognise nor analyse the
curious little stir which was in him as he walked home that
night&mdash;the feeling of a new gaiety, a new joyfulness, a sense
of something triumphant and as it were liberated and given
wings. He did not even get so far as to associate it explicitly
and consciously with Marie Sarradet, though he did know
that never had she seemed a dearer friend or a more winning
girl than she had that night. He stood by the brink of the
spring of love, but had not yet drunk of it nor recognised the
hand that had led him there.</p>

<p>The girl had gone back to her father and mixed him his
'night-cap' of hot toddy, as her custom was. While he
sipped it, she stood beside him, looking down into the fire,
still and meditative. Presently she became aware of his
bright beady eyes set on her with a glance half-apprehensive,
half-amused; she interpreted it easily.</p>

<p>"A long time saying good-night, was I, Pops? And you
think I've been flirting? Well, I haven't, and I couldn't
have if I'd wanted to. Mr. Lisle never flirts. Joe pretends
to sometimes, and Sidney&mdash;does. But Mr. Lisle&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"That needn't mean that a man has no serious intentions,"
Mr. Sarradet opined.</p>

<p>She smiled. "With the English I think it does. We're
not quite English, even after all this time, are we? At least
you and I aren't; Raymond is, I think."</p>

<p>"Raymond's a goose, English or not," said the father impatiently.
"He's in debt again, and I have to pay! I won't
leave my business to a spendthrift."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll get over it. He is silly but&mdash;only twenty-two.
Pops!"</p>

<p>"And at twenty you've as shrewd a head as I know on
your shoulders! Get over it he must or&mdash;&mdash;!" An indignant
gulp of his 'night-cap' ended the sentence.</p>

<p>"If you let him go in for something that he liked better
than the business&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"What business has he not to like the business! It's
kept us in comfort for a hundred and fifty years. Isn't it
good enough for him? It's been good enough for me and my
forefathers. We've known what we were; we've never pretended
to be anything else. We're honest merchants&mdash;shop-keepers.
That's what we are."</p>

<p>"Have patience, dear, I'll talk to him," she promised gently,
and soothed the old fellow, whose bark was worse than his bite.</p>

<p>"Well, he'll come to me for a cheque once too often, that's
all," he grumbled, as he kissed his daughter and took himself
off to bed.</p>

<p>"Honest merchants&mdash;shop-keepers. That's what we are."
The words echoed through Marie Sarradet's head. It was
easy to smile at them, both at their pride and at their humility,
easy to call ideas of that kind quite out of date. But what if
they did represent a truth, irrelevant perhaps nowadays for
public or political purposes, but having its relevance and importance
in personal relations, in its influence on mind and
feeling? This was the direction her thoughts took, though
she found no words, and only dim ideas by which to grope.
Presently the ideas grew concrete in the word which she had
herself suggested to Arthur Lisle and he had accepted with
alacrity. Sidney Barslow 'grated' on Arthur. It was not
impossible to see why, though even this she acknowledged
grudgingly and with a sense of treachery&mdash;she herself found
so much to like in Sidney! Exactly! There she seemed to
lay her finger on the spot. If she liked Sidney, and Sidney
grated on Arthur Lisle so badly&mdash;the question which she
had not dared to ask at the door rose to her lips again&mdash;"Do
I grate?" And was that why Arthur Lisle never flirted?
Never with her, at least&mdash;for that was all she could really
know on the subject.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h2>IN TOUCH WITH THE LAW</h2>


<p>Arthur Lisle arrived on the pavement in front
of Norton Ward's house in Manchester Square five
minutes before the time for which he was invited,
and fifteen before that at which he would be expected to arrive.
Painfully conscious of this fact, he walked first down Duke
Street, and then back up Manchester Street, trying to look
as if he were going somewhere else. Nor did he venture to
arrive at his real destination until he had seen three vehicles
deposit their occupants at the door. Then he presented himself
with the air of having hurried a little, lest he should be
late. None of this conduct struck him as at all unusual or
ridiculous; not only now but for long afterwards it was his
habit&mdash;the habit of a nervous imaginative man.</p>

<p>The party was not a large one&mdash;only twelve&mdash;and it was
entirely legal in character. Besides host and hostess there
were three couples&mdash;two barrister couples and one solicitor
couple. One of the couples brought a daughter, who fell to
Arthur's lot. Arthur got on very well with his girl, who
was fortunately an enthusiast about lawn-tennis; she
interested without absorbing him; he was able to be
polite without ceasing to watch the two people who really
arrested his attention, his hostess and&mdash;most strangely, most
wonderfully!&mdash;Mr. Justice Lance. For at half-past eight the
old Judge, by his arrival, completed the party.</p>

<p>A catalogue of Mrs. Norton Ward's personal attractions
would sound commonplace enough. She had small features,
was fair, rather pretty, rather pale, and rather short; there
seemed no more to say. But she possessed a gracious candour
of manner, an extreme friendliness and simplicity, a ready
merriment, and together with these a complete freedom from
self-consciousness. Somehow she struck Arthur as a highly
refined, feminised, etherealised counterpart of Joe Halliday&mdash;they
were both such good human creatures, so superlatively
free from 'nonsense' of all sorts. He took to her immensely
from the first moment and hoped very much that she would
talk to him a little after dinner. He felt sure that he could
get on with her; she did not alarm or puzzle him; he knew
that he had "got her right."</p>

<p>When Norton Ward moved, according to ritual, into his
wife's vacant place beside Mr. Justice Lance, he beckoned
to Arthur to come and sit on the Judge's other side and introduced
him. "You just missed the pleasure of hearing his
maiden argument the other morning, Judge," he added,
laughing slyly at Arthur, who had not got over the surprise
of encountering Lance, <span class="smcap">j</span>., as a private&mdash;and harmless&mdash;individual.</p>

<p>"Ah, I remember&mdash;a case of yours! But O'Sullivan
wouldn't give Mr. Lisle a chance!"</p>

<p>He spoke in the same soft, rather weary voice that he
had used in court; with his sparse white hair he looked
older than when he was in his wig; he was very carefully
dressed, and his thin fine hands wore a couple of rather
ornate rings. He had keen blue eyes and a large well-shaped
nose.</p>

<p>"I don't know that Lisle was altogether sorry! The first
time! Even you remember the feeling, I dare say?"</p>

<p>"Nervous? Was that it, Mr. Lisle?" He smiled faintly.
"You must remember that we're much inured to imperfection."
He looked on the young man with a pleasant indulgence,
and, at the same time, a certain attention.</p>

<p>"You always remember our frailty, but there are others!"
said the host.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah! I sat with my Brother Pretyman, so I did!
Perhaps he does forget sometimes that one side must be
wrong. Hence the unpopularity of litigation, by the way."</p>

<p>Arthur was gaining his ease; the friendliness of both his
companions helped him; towards the Judge he was particularly
drawn; he felt that he would be all right before Lance, <span class="smcap">j</span>.,
in future&mdash;if only Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j</span>., were elsewhere! But, alas,
a question was enough to plunge him back into trouble.
Norton Ward had turned to talk to his other neighbour, but
Sir Christopher Lance spoke to him again.</p>

<p>"Are you any relation to Godfrey Lisle? Lisle of Hilsey,
you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Christopher, I'm&mdash;I'm a distant cousin."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought you had something of the family look.
I've not had the pleasure of seeing you at his house&mdash;in town,
I mean&mdash;I haven't been to Hilsey lately."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I've never been there," Arthur stammered. He was
blushing very red. Here he was, up against this terrible
business of the Godfrey Lisles again&mdash;and just as he had
begun to get along so nicely!</p>

<p>His confusion, nay, his distress, could not escape the Judge.
"I hope I haven't made a <i>faux pas</i>, Mr. Lisle? No quarrel,
or anything of that sort, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but I don't know them. I haven't called yet,"
Arthur blurted out; he seemed to himself to be always
having to blurt it out.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher's eyes twinkled, as, following the host's
example, he rose from the table.</p>

<p>"If I were you, I should. You don't know what you're
missing."</p>

<p>Upstairs Mrs. Norton Ward was better than Arthur's hopes.
She showed him at once that she meant to talk to him and
that she expected to like doing it.</p>

<p>"I'm always friends with everybody in Frank's chambers,"
she said, as she made him sit by her. "I consider them all
part of the family, and all the glory they win belongs to the
family; so you must make haste and win glory, if you can,
for us!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't win glory," laughed Arthur. "At
least it doesn't look like it&mdash;at the Bar."</p>

<p>"Oh, win it anyhow&mdash;we're not particular how&mdash;law,
politics, literature, what you like! Why, Milton Longworth
was Frank's pupil once&mdash;for a month! He did no work and
got tipsy, but he's a great poet now&mdash;well, isn't he?&mdash;and
we're just as proud as if he'd become Attorney-General."</p>

<p>"Or&mdash;well&mdash;at all events, a County Court Judge!" Arthur
suggested.</p>

<p>"So just you do it somehow, Mr. Lisle, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," he promised, laughing. "The other day I heard
of you in your glory. You sounded very splendid," he
added.</p>

<p>Then he had to tell her all about how he had heard, about
Mildred Quain, and so about the rest of the circle in Regent's
Park. His shyness vanished; he gave humorous little sketches
of his friends. Of course she knew Sarradet's shop, and was
amused at this lifting of the veil which had hidden the Sarradet
private life. But being the entirely natural creature she was,
talking and thinking just as one of her class naturally would,
she could not help treating the Sarradets as something out
of her ordinary experience, as something rather funny&mdash;perhaps
also instructive&mdash;to hear about, as social phenomena
to be observed and studied. Without her own volition or
consciousness her mind naturally assumed this attitude and
expressed it in her questions and comments; neither were
cruel, neither malicious, but both were absolutely from the
outside&mdash;comments and questions about a foreign country
addressed to a traveller who happened to have paid a visit
there; for plainly she assumed, again instinctively, that
Arthur Lisle was no more a native of that country than herself.
Or he might almost have been an author presenting to
an alert and sympathetic reader a realistic and vivacious
picture of the life of a social class not his own, be it what is
called higher or lower, or just quite different.</p>

<p>Whatever the gulf, the difference, might be&mdash;broad or
narrow, justly felt or utterly exaggerated&mdash;Arthur Lisle
would have been (at twenty-four) more than human not to
be pleased to find himself, for Mrs. Norton Ward, on the same
side of it as Mrs. Norton Ward. She was evidently quite
genuine in this, as she seemed to be in everything. She was
not flattering him or even putting him at his ease. She talked
to him as "one of ourselves" simply because that seemed to
her what he undoubtedly was&mdash;and what his friends undoubtedly,
though of course quite blamelessly, were not.</p>

<p>They were thus in the full swing of talk&mdash;Arthur doing
most of it&mdash;when the Judge came across the room and joined
them. Arthur at once rose, to make way, and the lady too
seemed to treat his audience as finished, although most
graciously. But the Judge took hold of his arm and detained
him.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Esther," he said, "that this young man
has, by right of kinship, the <i>entrÃ©e</i> to the Shrine? And he
doesn't use it!"</p>

<p>"What?" she cried with an appearance of lively interest.
"Oh, are you related to the Godfreys, Mr. Lisle?"</p>

<p>Arthur blushed, but this time less acutely; he was getting,
as the Judge might have put it, much inured to this matter
of the Godfrey Lisles.</p>

<p>"Don't ask him questions about it; for some reason or
another he doesn't like that."</p>

<p>"I don't really think my cousin Godfrey would care
about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not the least the point, is it, Esther?" said the Judge
with a twinkle.</p>

<p>"Not the least, Sir Christopher. But what's to be done if
he won't go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you must manage that." He squeezed Arthur's arm
and then let it go.</p>

<p>Here, plainly, though no less graciously than from the
hostess, was his dismissal. Not knowing any of the other
women, he drifted back to the girl who was enthusiastic about
lawn-tennis.</p>

<p>The Judge sat down and stretched out his shapely thin
hands towards the fire; his rings gleamed, and he loved the
gleam of them. To wear them had been, from his youth,
one of his bits of daring; he had, as it were, backed himself
to wear them and not thereby seem himself, or let them seem,
vulgar. And he had succeeded; he had been called vain
often, never vulgar. By now his friends, old and young,
would have missed them sadly.</p>

<p>"What do you make of that boy, Esther?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I like him&mdash;and I think he's being wasted," she answered
promptly.</p>

<p>"At our honourable profession?"</p>

<p>"You and Frank are better judges of that."</p>

<p>"I don't know. Hardly tough enough, perhaps. But
Huntley was just such a man, and he got pretty well to the
top. Died, though, not much past fifty. The climb killed
him, I think."</p>

<p>"Yes, Frank's told me about him. But I meant wasted
in his own life, or socially, or however you like to put it.
He's told me about his friends, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, if you like him enough, you can put that right,
Esther."</p>

<p>"I like him, but I haven't much time for young men, Sir
Christopher. I've a husband, you may remember."</p>

<p>"Then turn him over where he belongs&mdash;to Bernadette."</p>

<p>She raised her brows a little, as she smiled at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, the young fellow's got to get his baptism of fire.
It'll do him good."</p>

<p>"How easily you Judges settle other people's fortunes!"</p>

<p>"In the end, his not going to his cousin's house is an
absurdity."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, so it is, in the end, of course," she agreed.
"It shall be done, Sir Christopher."</p>

<p>While his fortunes were thus being settled for him&mdash;more
or less, and as the future might reveal&mdash;Arthur was
walking home, well pleased with himself. The lady's friendliness
delighted him; if he did not prize the old Judge's so
highly, he had the sense to perceive that it was really a more
valuable testimonial and brought with it more substantial
encouragement. From merely being kind to him the Norton
Wards had come to like him, as it seemed, and their liking
was backed by Sir Christopher's endorsement. He did not
regard these things from a worldly point of view; he did not
think of them as stepping-stones, or at any rate only quite
indirectly. They would no doubt help him to get rid of, or at
least to hold in subjection, his demon of self-distrust; but
still more would they comfort him and make him happy.
The pleasure he derived from Mrs. Norton Ward's liking, and
the Judge's approval, was in quality akin to the gratification
which Marie Sarradet's bearing had given him a few nights
ago in Regent's Park; just as that had roused in him a
keener sense of Marie's attractiveness, so now he glowed
with a warm recognition of the merits of his new
friends.</p>

<p>Walking home along Oxford Street, he had almost reached
the corner of Tottenham Court Road when his complacent
musings were interrupted by the sight of a knot of people
outside the door of a public-house. It was the sort of group
not unusual at half-past eleven o'clock at night&mdash;a man,
a woman on his arm, a policeman, ten or a dozen interested
spectators, very ready with advice as Londoners are.
As he drew near, he heard what was passing, though the
policeman's tall burly figure was between him and the
principal actor in the scene.</p>

<p>"Better do as she says and go 'ome, sir," said the policeman
soothingly.</p>

<p>"'Ome, <i>Sweet</i> 'Ome!" murmured somebody in tones of
fond reminiscence.</p>

<p>"Yes, do now. You don't really want it, you know you
don't," urged the lady in her turn.</p>

<p>"Whether I want it or not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the sound of this last voice Arthur started into quick
attention and came to a halt. He recognised the full tones,
now somewhat thickened, with their faint but unmistakable
suggestion of the Cockney twang.</p>

<p>"Whether I want it or not&mdash;&mdash;" The man spoke slowly,
with an effort after distinctness which was obvious but not
unsuccessful&mdash;"I've a right to have it. He's bound to serve
the public. I'm&mdash;I'm member of the public."</p>

<p>"'Ad enough for two members, <i>I</i> should sye," came in
comment from the fringe of the group.</p>

<p>"That's it! Go 'ome now," the policeman suggested
again, infinitely patient and persuasive.</p>

<p>The man made a sudden move towards the door of the
public-house where an official, vulgarly known as the 'chucker
out,' stood smiling on the threshold.</p>

<p>"No, sir, you <i>don't</i>!" said the policeman, suave but immensely
firm, laying a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"The officer's quite right. Do come along," again urged
the lady.</p>

<p>But the movement towards the public-house door, which
revealed to Arthur the face of the obstinate lingerer, showed
him to the lingerer also&mdash;showed Arthur in his evening uniform
of tall hat, white scarf, and silk-faced coat to Sidney
Barslow in his 'bowler' hat of rakish cut, and his sporting
fawn-coloured coat, with the big flower in his buttonhole
and his stick with a huge silver knob. The stick shot out&mdash;vaguely
in Arthur's direction.</p>

<p>"I'm a gentleman, and, what's more, I can prove it. Ask
that gentleman&mdash;my friend there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Arthur's face was a little flushed. His mind was full of
those terrible quick visions of his&mdash;a scuffle on the pavement,
going bail for Sidney Barslow, giving evidence at the Police
Court. "A friend of the prisoner, Mr. Arthur Lisle, Barrister,
of Garden Court, Middle Temple"&mdash;visions most terrible!
But he stood his ground, saying nothing, not moving a limb,
and meeting Barslow's look full in the eyes. All the rest
were staring at him now. If he remained as he was they would
take it as a denial of Barslow's claim to acquaintance. Could
he deny it if Barslow challenged him? He answered&mdash;No.</p>

<p>But some change of mood came over Sidney Barslow's
clouded mind. He let his stick fall back to his side again,
and with an angry jerk of his head said:</p>

<p>"Oh, damn it, all right, I'm going! I&mdash;I was only pulling
your leg."</p>

<p>"That's right now!" applauded the policeman. "You'd
better take 'im in a taxi, miss."</p>

<p>"And put a ticket on 'im, in case 'e falls out, miss," some
friendly adviser added.</p>

<p>Arthur did not wait to see the policeman's excellent suggestion
carried into effect. The moment that Sidney Barslow's
eyes were off him, he turned quickly up a by-street, and took
a roundabout way home.</p>

<p>He had much to be thankful for. The terrible visions were
dissipated. And&mdash;he had not run away. Oh, how he had
wanted to run away from the danger of being mixed up in
that dirty job. He thanked heaven that he had stood his
ground and looked Barslow in the face.</p>

<p>But what about the next time they had to look one another
in the face&mdash;at the Sarradets' in Regent's Park?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h2>A GRATEFUL FRIEND</h2>


<p>Marie's remonstrance with her brother was not ill-received&mdash;Raymond
was too amiable for that&mdash;but
it was quite unsuccessful. Just emerged from
an exhaustive business training on the latest lines at home and
abroad, able (as he pointed out in mingled pride and ruefulness)
to correspond about perfumes in French, German,
Spanish, and Italian, and to talk about them in three of those
languages, he declared openly not for a lifetime of leisure
but for an hedonistic interval. Further, he favoured a little
scattering of money after so much amassing.</p>

<p>"If Pops," he observed, "would only go back to his
Balzac, he would see how much harm and sorrow this perpetual
money-grubbing causes among the business classes
of our beloved France. In England a more liberal spirit prevails,
and after a hundred and fifty years we ought to be
able to catch it. In fact I have caught it, Marie."</p>

<p>"You have; and you'll catch something else&mdash;from Pops&mdash;if
you don't look out," said Marie, who could not help
smiling at the trim, spry, gay little fellow. Like herself, he
was dark and lively, but of the two she was the manager,
the man of business.</p>

<p>"Besides it does the house good. 'Who's that?' they ask.
'Young Sarradet.' 'What, the scent and soap people?'
'The same.' 'Dashed fine business that!'" He enacted the
dialogue with dramatic talent. "As an advertisement I'm
worth all my debts, dear sister."</p>

<p>Marie was too much amused to press her point further.
"You rather remind me of Bob Sawyer," she remarked.
"But, anyhow, be here oftener in the evenings, if you can.
That'll go a long way towards pacifying Pops. When you're
away, he sits thinking of the money you're spending. Besides,
he does like to have you here, you know."</p>

<p>"You tell me when Amabel Osling is coming, and I'll be
here."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like Amabel. She's pretty, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"She's all right. Otherwise I didn't think it was very
lively."</p>

<p>"N-no. It was hardly one of our best evenings," Marie
admitted reluctantly.</p>

<p>It hadn't been&mdash;that first meeting of her circle after Arthur
Lisle's dinner party. They had all been there, including
Raymond, whose exchanges of wit and chaff with Joe
Halliday were generally of themselves enough to make the
evening a success. It had not been a success&mdash;at least from
the moment of Arthur's arrival. Mildred Quain had started
off about the party at once; her curiosity concerning the
Norton Wards was insatiable&mdash;she seemed to be working up
a regular cult of them. Marie herself had been benevolently
inquisitive too, hoping to hear that Arthur had had a grand
time and made a great impression. But the topic had seemed
distasteful to Arthur, he tried to get away from it directly;
when the persevering Mildred dragged him back, his replies
grew short and his manner reserved; he seemed ill at ease.
As for Sidney Barslow, as soon as ever Arthur and his party
came on the scene, he turned sulky&mdash;indecently sulky. It
was painful as well as absurd, and it got worse when Joe
Halliday, trying (in justice let it be said) to lighten the atmosphere
by jocularity, suggested, "And, after it all, I suppose
some beautiful lady took you to your humble home in her
six-cylinder car?" Arthur answered dryly, with a pointed
ignoring of the joke, "I walked home by Oxford Street."
Joe, still persevering, asked, "No romantic adventures on
the way?" "Nothing out of the common," Arthur replied in
a cool hard voice which was very rare in his mouth, but
meant, Marie knew, serious displeasure. In fact she was
just going to make some laughing apology for the catechism
through which he had been put when Sidney Barslow, who
had been glowering worse and worse every minute, suddenly
broke out:</p>

<p>"There's an end of the thing, at all events, at last!" And
he looked at Arthur, as it seemed to her, with a curious mixture
of anger and fear, a sort of snarling defiance.</p>

<p>"It was not I who introduced the subject or was responsible
for its continuance," said Arthur, in the iciest of all his
cool voices. "That you must do me the justice to admit,
Barslow."</p>

<p>Then an awful pause&mdash;even Joe gravelled for a joke&mdash;and
the most obvious clumsy resort to "a little more music"!
The strains failed of soothing effect. On the one side a careful
but disdainful courtesy, on the other a surly defiance&mdash;they
persisted all the evening, making everybody uncomfortable
and (as Marie shrewdly guessed) inquisitive. This was something
much worse, much more pronounced, than mere
'grating.' There was, on Sidney's side at least, an actual
enmity; and Arthur, noting it, treated it with contemptuous
indifference.</p>

<p>"Have you had a row with Sidney about anything?" she
managed to whisper to Arthur.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have you said anything to annoy him, do you
think?"</p>

<p>He looked straight into her eyes. "I haven't spoken to
him since we were last here."</p>

<p>Sidney she did not venture to approach in confidence; he
was altogether too dangerous that night. She did not know
the occasion which had fanned a smouldering hostility into
flame, which had changed a mere 'grating' of the one on
the other, an uncongeniality, into feelings much stronger and
more positive. Even had she known it, perhaps she was not
well enough versed in the standards and the moods of men
to understand all that it carried with it. Sidney Barslow
was not particularly ashamed of what had happened to him
in itself: in suitable company he would have found it a story
he could tell and be sure of a humorous sympathy; there
was nothing to be remorseful or miserable about. As long as
a man did his work and earned his 'screw' (and Sidney
held a good position in a wholesale linen-merchant's business
and was doing well) he was entitled to his amusements&mdash;if
you like, his dissipations&mdash;while he was young at all events.
If indiscretions marked them, if one sometimes tumbled over
the line, that was in the nature of the case. He would not
have minded an encounter with Joe Halliday outside that
public-house in the least&mdash;no, nor even with young Raymond
Sarradet, Marie's brother though he was. Nay, he would
not much have minded being seen even by Arthur Lisle
himself; for if Arthur had been shocked, Sidney would, in
all sincerity, have dubbed him a milksop; the man who
would be shocked at a thing like that was certainly a milksop.
He was not even afraid of Arthur's betraying him to Marie&mdash;not
because he thought his enemy above that, but because
he had an easy confidence that he could put the matter right
with Marie, and a strong doubt whether women objected to
that sort of thing so much as they were in the habit of pretending;
in their hearts they like a man to be a man, Sidney
would have told himself for comfort.</p>

<p>The poison lay elsewhere. Under the influence of his liquor
and the stress of his plight&mdash;wanting to prove to the policeman,
to the 'chucker-out,' to the interested bystanders,
that he was not a common tap-room frequenter but a 'gentleman'&mdash;he
had let himself appeal for his warrant of gentility
to the man whom he had derided for thinking himself so much
(if you please!) a gentleman. Arthur Lisle's acquaintance
was to prove to bystanders, policeman, and chucker-out,
that he, Sidney Barslow, though drunk and in queer company,
was yet a gentleman! And how had the appeal been received?
He could not charge Arthur with cutting him, or leaving him
in the lurch. He hated far worse the look he had seen in his
enemy's eyes as they gazed steadfastly into his&mdash;the fastidious
repulsion and the high contempt. True, on the sight of them
he had withdrawn his appeal; he had preferred to accept
defeat and humiliation at the hands of chucker-out and
constable; but the fact of the appeal having been made
remained with all its damning admission of inferiority. And
that look of contempt he had seen again when Arthur Lisle,
in answer to Joe Halliday's clumsy jokes, replied in his cool
proud voice that, as he walked home by Oxford Street, he had
met with "nothing out of the common." He had met a common
fellow with a common woman, and, as was common, the
common fellow was drunk. With all the sharpness wherewith
humiliation pricks a man, with all the keenness wherewith
hatred can read the mind of an enemy, he pointed for himself
the meaning of Arthur's careless-sounding words.</p>

<p>He was in a rage, not only with Arthur Lisle, but with himself
and his luck&mdash;which had indeed been somewhat perverse.
Lashing himself with these various irritants, he soon produced
another sore spot&mdash;Marie Sarradet's behaviour. He
was an older friend than Arthur; she had, he declared,
backed Arthur up in his airy insolence; he swore to himself
that he had seen her smile at it. At any rate she had not
backed him up; to a man in a rage, or several rages, it was
enough&mdash;more than enough for a man of his temper, to whom
the desire for a woman was the desire for a mastery over her.
And in the end he could not believe that that fragile whipper-snapper
with his hoity-toity effeminate ways (the point of
view is Sidney's) could be weighed in the balance against his
own manly handsomeness, his dashing gallantry; why, he
knew that he was a conqueror with women&mdash;knew it by
experience!</p>

<p>Marie and Raymond, Amabel Osling and himself had made
up a four to play lawn-tennis on the hard courts at Acton.
They had enjoyed their game and their tea. He and Marie
had won after a close match, and were in a good humour with
themselves. He was forgetting his grievance against her.
She liked him playing games; he was a finely built fellow
and looked really splendid in his white flannels; if he ordered
her about the court like a master, it was a legitimate sway;
he knew the game and played well. When, after tea, the
other two sauntered off&mdash;for an open and unashamed flirtation&mdash;Marie
had never felt more kindly towards him; she had
really forgiven the bearishness of his behaviour, and was
prepared to tell him so after a little lecture, which, by the way,
she quite looked forward to giving; for she too was fond of
domination. She started leading up to the lecture.</p>

<p>"You seem to have found something since we last met,
Sidney. I'm glad of it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked carelessly, as he filled
his pipe. He did not see her drift.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you mislaid something the other night?" Her
dark eyes were dancing with mockery, and her lips twitched.</p>

<p>Now he looked at her suspiciously. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>"You might. I'm referring to your temper."</p>

<p>"I'm not aware that I said anything rude to you. If I
did, I apologise."</p>

<p>"I'm not speaking of myself, but of my friends&mdash;my
guests."</p>

<p>He leant his arm on the table which stood between them.
"Meaning Mr. Arthur Lisle?"</p>

<p>"The smoke of your pipe blows in my face when you lean
forward like that."</p>

<p>"Sorry!" He laid his pipe down beside him. "Well, the
fact is, I'm about fed up with Lisle."</p>

<p>And Arthur Lisle was much in the same case&mdash;allowing
for the difference of expression&mdash;as to Sidney! Marie smiled,
but her brow wrinkled. "Sorry you don't like him, but it
costs nothing to be polite."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is that I shall be very much obliged
if you'll ask us on different evenings."</p>

<p>"That's assuming that I'm going to ask you on any evenings
at all."</p>

<p>She thought this smart flick of her whip would bring him
to reason.</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps Lisle's going to be there every evening?"</p>

<p>"Any evening that he likes, Pops and I will be very pleased
to see him&mdash;with or without an invitation." She relented a
little; he looked angry and obstinate, but he looked handsome
too. "You too, if you won't be silly. Why do you
dislike him so much?"</p>

<p>He could not give her the whole reason; he gave what he
could. "I see his game. He's always trying to come the
swell over me and the rest of us."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he doesn't mean to; it's just&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His naturally aristocratic manner?" he sneered.</p>

<p>Marie sat up straight and looked composedly at him. By
now she was angry&mdash;and she meant to hurt. "That's exactly
it, Sidney," she said, "and it's a pity everybody hasn't
got it."</p>

<p>She did hurt sorely. He had no code to keep him from
hitting back, and his wrath was fierce. "Where did you learn
so much about aristocratic manners? Behind the counter?"</p>

<p>She flushed hotly; tears came in her eyes. He saw what
he had done, and was touched to a sudden remorse.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, Marie, I didn't mean&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I shan't forget that," she said. "Never!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and stuck his pipe back in his
mouth. He was ashamed, but obstinate still. "You brought
it on yourself," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I forgot that I wasn't talking to a gentleman."</p>

<p>He made one more effort after reconciliation. "Look here,
Marie, you know what I think of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;you've just told me."</p>

<p>"Damnation!" he muttered, pulling at his pipe. Marie,
looking carefully past him, began to put on her gloves. Thus
Amabel and Raymond found them&mdash;with things obviously
very wrong. Amabel diagnosed an offer and a refusal, but
Raymond thought there must be even more behind his sister's
stormy brow and clouded eyes. The journey back was not
cheerful.</p>

<p>Marie was indeed cut to the quick. Even to herself it was
strange how deeply she was wounded. The Sarradets had never
been ashamed of the shop; rather they had taken an honourable
pride in it and in the growth of its fortunes from generation
to generation. Yet Sidney Barslow's gibe about the
counter was to her now unforgivable. It brought into coarse
and vivid relief her secret doubts and fears. It made her
ask whether she, having made a friend of the man who had
used a taunt like that, must not have something about her
to justify it. It set her on fire to put an utter end to her
friendship and association with Sidney Barslow&mdash;and thereby
to prove to herself that, whatever her manners might be
they were at least too good for such company as his.</p>

<p>Hitherto pretty equally balanced between the two young
men, or at all events wistfully anxious that friendship with
Arthur should not make impossible her old and pleasant
comradeship with Sidney&mdash;in whom she found so much
that she liked&mdash;she became now Arthur's furious partisan.
With him and his cause she identified herself. She declared
that it was purely for his sake, and not at all in the interest
of her own domination and authority, that she had rebuked
Sidney, and for his sake solely that she had suffered insult.
By a natural turn of feeling she asked in her heart for a
reward from him, a recognition of her championship, gratitude
to her for having preferred him to his would-be rival;
if he were not at least a little pleased and proud, she would
feel disappointment and humiliation.</p>

<p>But he would be. And why? Because that was the right
thing for him to be, and now in her eyes, at this moment, he
could do no wrong. Sidney was all wrong, therefore Arthur
must be all right. She could not bring herself to doubt it.
And, being all right, he must do and feel all the right things.
So he would&mdash;when he knew what she had done and suffered
for him. Her heart cried out that somehow (as delicately as
possible, of course) he must be made to know, to know the
full extent of her service and her sacrifice; he must know
the insult she had received; and he must consider it as great
and wanton an insult as she did.</p>

<p>So her feelings formulated their claim upon him, with an
instinctive cunning. It was a claim to which no chivalrous-minded
man could be insensible; it was one that would
appeal with commanding force to Arthur Lisle's impulsive
generosity.</p>

<p>"For you I have quarrelled with my old friend&mdash;for you
I have endured insult." What could he answer save that in
him she should find a better friend, that his appreciation
should efface the insult?</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid to come. There will be nobody here that
you don't like this time." With these words her next invitation
to Arthur Lisle ended.</p>

<p>He read them with a quick grasp of her meaning&mdash;of the
essential part of it at least. She was on his side! He was
glad. Neither for his own sake, nor for the sake of the idea
that he had of her, would he easily have endured that she
should be on Sidney Barslow's side and against him. Although
she did not know what he knew, and had not seen what he
had seen, her instincts and her taste were right! He looked
forward eagerly to letting her perceive, in some way or other,
that he recognised this, to congratulating her somehow on
it, to sealing the pact of a natural alliance between them.
How he would do this, or how far he might seem to go in the
course of doing it, or what further implications might be
involved in such a bond between man and maid, his young
blood and his generous impulses did not pause to ask. It
was the thing to do&mdash;and he wanted to do it.</p>

<h2>THE TENDER DIPLOMATIST</h2>


<p>The coming of the Easter legal vacation set Arthur
free for the time from professional hopes and fears.
He was due on a visit to his mother and sister at
Malvern, but excused himself at the last moment. It was not
in him to leave London. The Temple indeed he forsook, but
he abode in his lodgings and spent his spare time with the
Sarradets. Amabel Osling was staying with them, and
Raymond was now in close attendance on her. There were
two young couples, then, ready for lawn-tennis, for theatres,
for concerts, or any other diversion. Yet pleasantest of all
were the walks in Regent's Park on the offdays, when nothing
special had been arranged, but Arthur would happen to stroll
up to the Broad Walk, and Marie would chance to be giving
her dog a run. Then they would saunter about together, or
sit on a seat in the spring sunshine, talking of all manner of
things&mdash;well, except of the particular form which Sidney
Barslow's rudeness had taken. Somehow, in the end, Marie
never could bring herself to tell him that and ask him to be
indignant about it. She left the enormity vague and undefined;
it was really none the less effective left like that,
just as provocative of reprobation for the sinner and sympathy
for the ill-used friend. And it was safer to leave it like that;
she could never rid herself of the fear that the actual thing,
if revealed, might appear to Arthur rude indeed&mdash;rough, ill-mannered,
as much of all this as one could conceive&mdash;but not
so overwhelmingly absurd and monstrous as it ought to
seem, as the demands of her uneasy heart required that he
should find it.</p>

<p>For she could hardly believe in what looked now like
coming to pass. She had known him for a long time&mdash;more
than a year&mdash;as a good friend but rather a reserved one;
cordial and kind, but keeping always a certain distance,
actually, if without intention, maintaining a barrier round
his inner self, refusing to abandon the protective aloofness of
a proud and sensitive nature. Was he changing from this to
the opposite extreme&mdash;to that most open, intimate, exposed,
and unprotected creature, a lover? Well as she had known
him, she had not thought of him as that. But her mind
fastened on the idea eagerly; it appealed to more than one
side of her nature.</p>

<p>"As a rule I just can't talk about myself," he said once.
"How is it that I can to you?"</p>

<p>"It's because I love you, and in your heart you know it,"
she wanted to say, but she answered, laughing, "I've always
been rather a good listener."</p>

<p>"If you tell most people a single thing about yourself,
they bombard you with a dozen silly questions. Now you
never do that."</p>

<p>"That's because I'm afraid of you, if you only knew it,"
she wanted to say, but she answered merrily, "I find out
more by my way in the end, don't I?"</p>

<p>For every step forward his feelings had taken, hers had
taken ten. She knew it and was not ashamed; she gloried
in it. From the moment she had come over to his side, making
herself his champion and asking for his gratitude in return,
her heart had brooked no compromise. Hers was a mind
quick of decision, prompt in action. To romance she brought
the qualities of business. A swift rush of feeling had carried
her to the goal; she watched him now following in her steps,
and was tremulously careful not to anticipate by an iota the
stages he had yet to pass. She marvelled that she had not
loved him from the beginning, and almost convinced herself
that she had. She could scarcely persuade herself to accept
even now the signs of his nascent love.</p>

<p>Thus in truth, though all unknown to him, she did the
wooing. Her answer was ready before his question. She
watched and waited with a passivity that was to a man of
his disposition her best lure. Some of this fine caution she
learnt from her observation of him, and some of it from
Sidney Barslow's taunt. She subdued her natural coquetry
lest, even in eyes the most unfriendly and malicious, it should
seem forwardness. She gave always just a little, little less
than his words and eyes asked. Schooling herself after this
fashion, modelling her behaviour to what she conceived to
be his ideals, she sought to win him. If she succeeded she
would achieve not only her heart's desire, but a great triumph
over those disturbing doubts. His approval would, she felt,
set on her the stamp that she longed to wear&mdash;the social
diploma to which she aspired. A fine slap in the face for
Sidney Barslow it would be, for instance!</p>

<p>Arthur's generous impulse, the desire to show himself a
warm and grateful friend to his champion, was merged now
in a great and absorbing contentment. It prevented him
from considering how an engagement and a marriage would
consort with his prospects and his career; it narrowed his
vision of his own life and mind to the present moment. He
had got what he had been pining for&mdash;that intimate and (so
to say) ministering sympathy which a man perhaps can get,
and certainly can ask, from a woman only. That had
been a need so great that its satisfaction seemed to satisfy
all the needs of his being, and deluded him into thinking
that all his instincts and aspirations asked no more than
this, that his keen appetite for beauty could be fed on
her vivacious prettiness, that all his impulses, wayward,
fanciful, sometimes extravagant, could be lulled to sleep
by the spell of her shrewd and pleasant common sense. It
made him forget that the prime function of a lover and
his supreme expression lie in giving, and that the woman
truly makes the man in love with her when she makes him
give all he has and think that he is giving brass for gold.
But if this it is to be a lover, Arthur Lisle was no lover now;
if this it is to be a lover, Marie Sarradet had never seen and
scarce imagined one.</p>

<p>But the spring sunshine, the impulses of youth, the ministering
sympathy blinded his eyes. He seemed to have all because
he liked so much that which he had. Gaily and happily, with
that fine gallantry which she so admired, on he came, step by
step. She grew secure.</p>

<p>By now father and brother were on the alert. They had
canvassed the matter in all its bearings. Raymond was
Arthur's enthusiastic adherent. Old Mr. Sarradet affected
reserve and doubt; he complained that the suitor was far
from rich. But in his heart he was delighted at the prospect.
He admired Arthur, he believed in his abilities, he thought
the marriage would be a "step up" for his darling daughter&mdash;and
perhaps for her family. Above all he saw the time draw
near when he should enjoy the greatest pleasure that he had
to look forward to in life&mdash;surprising Marie by the handsome
dimensions of her dowry. He hugged the thought of it; he
loved her, and he knew she was a good woman of business.
It would be a great moment when she saw in him, at one and
the same moment, a more munificent father and a cleverer
man of business than ever she had thought. Incidentally
the disclosure might cause Master Raymond to realise what
very considerable things he stood to lose if he did not mind
what he was about. The old fellow had no real thought of
disinheriting his son, but he loved the power his money gave
him, and would now and again flourish the sword that he
would have been most loth to use.</p>

<p>So all things promised bravely&mdash;Marie, the tender diplomatist,
held a winning hand and was playing it well. Leave
her to the skill that her heart taught her, and the game was
won!</p>

<p>Among the accidents of life are relatives appurtenant to
but ordinarily outside of the family circle. Mr. Sarradet
owned one&mdash;an elder sister&mdash;in his eyes, by early memory
and tradition, exceptionally endowed with the knowledge
of the way to look after girls, and the proper things to be done
in the interest of their dignity and virtue. She came up
from Manchester, where she lived, to have her teeth seen to&mdash;not
that there were not excellent dentists in Manchester,
but her father had always gone to Mr. Mandells of Seymour
Street and she had a fancy to go to Mr. Mandells's son (of
Seymour Street still)&mdash;and stayed with her brother from Friday
to Tuesday. Having seen what she saw, and had her doubts,
and come to her own conclusions, she sat up late on Monday
night, sat up till Arthur Lisle had departed and Marie was
between the sheets, and even Raymond had yawned himself
on to bed; and then she said abruptly to her brother Mr.
Sarradet:</p>

<p>"It's a settled thing, I suppose, though it's not announced
yet?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sarradet passed his hand over his hair-brush of a head,
and pulled his moustache perplexedly. "I suppose it is," he
answered lamely, quite conscious that Mrs. Veltheim possessed
knowledge and commanded deference, but conscious
also that, up to now, matters had gone on very well without
her.</p>

<p>"You suppose!" said the lady. The two words carried
home to a conscience hitherto guiltily easy. But Mrs. Veltheim
left nothing to chance; she rammed the charge in. "If
dear Marie had a mother!"</p>

<p>She alarmed the cautious old <i>bourgeois</i>&mdash;to the point of
protesting that he felt no alarm whatever.</p>

<p>"He's a gentleman." He took a sip at his toddy. "No
girl in the world has more self-respect." Another sip ended
in "Perfect confidence!" vaguely murmured.</p>

<p>"Young men are young men."</p>

<p>"Not at all! I don't believe it of him for a minute." His
protest was against the insinuation which even an identical
proposition may carry.</p>

<p>"I rescued my Harriet just in time!"</p>

<p>"Damn your Harriet, and I wish you'd go back to Manchester!"
It was not what he said to his respected sister.
"Cases differ," was the more parliamentary form his answer
took.</p>

<p>But the seed was sown before Mrs. Veltheim did go back
to Manchester. It germinated in the cautious suspicious
soul of the old shopkeeper, so trustful of a man's credit till
the breath of a suspicion blew upon it, then so acute to note
every eddying current of the air. He grew minded to confront
Arthur Lisle with the attitude of Mrs. Veltheim&mdash;a lady
for whom Arthur, on the strength of one evening's acquaintance,
had conceived a most profound aversion.</p>

<p>She was a fat woman&mdash;broad, heavy, fair and florid, married
to an exceedingly prosperous German. To Mr. Sarradet her
opinion was, like her person, weighty; not always agreeable,
but never unimportant. To Arthur she was already&mdash;before
ever he had conceived of her as having or being
entitled to have an opinion about him, his sentiments,
or his intentions&mdash;an appreciable drawback, though not
a serious obstacle, to the alliance which he was contemplating.
He was, in fine, extremely glad that she and
her husband, whom he defined and incarnated with all his
imagination's power of vividness, lived in Manchester. If
they too had dwelt in Regent's Park, it would not have been
the same place to him. Collateral liabilities would have lurked
round every corner.</p>

<p>By now, and notwithstanding a transitory disturbance
created by the revelation of Mrs. Veltheim, Arthur's mind had
subconsciously chosen its course; but emotionally he was not
quite ready. His feelings waited for a spark to set them in a
blaze&mdash;such a spark as might come any moment when he was
with Marie, some special note of appeal sounded by her, some
quick intuition of him or his mood, raising his admiration
and gratitude, even some especially pretty aspect of her face
suddenly striking on his sense of beauty. Any one of these
would serve, but one of them was needed to change his present
contentment into an impulse towards something conceived
as yet more perfect. The tender shrewd diplomatist divined
pretty well how things stood; she would not hurry or strive,
that way danger lay; she waited, securely now and serenely,
for the divine chance, the happy coincidence of opportunity
and impulse. It was bound to come, and to come now speedily.
Alas, she did not know that clumsy hands had been meddling
with her delicate edifice!</p>

<p>Two days after Mrs. Veltheim had gone back to Manchester,
old Sarradet left his place of business early, travelled by
omnibus from Cheapside to the corner of Bloomsbury Street,
and presented himself at the door of Arthur's lodgings.
Arthur was at home; Marie had told him that she would
not be able to meet him in Regent's Park that afternoon, as
some shopping business called her elsewhere, and he was
lounging through the hours, not (as it happened, and it does
happen sometimes even when a man is in love) thinking
about her much, but rather about that problem of his legal
career which the waning of the vacation brought again to
his mind. The appearance of Mr. Sarradet&mdash;who had never
before honoured him with a visit&mdash;came as something of a
surprise.</p>

<p>"As I was passing your corner, I thought I'd look in and
see if you were coming up to our place this afternoon," Mr.
Sarradet explained. "Because, if so, we might walk together."</p>

<p>Arthur said that he understood that Marie would be out,
and therefore had not proposed to pay his friends a visit that
day.</p>

<p>"Out, is she? Ah, yes!" He smiled knowingly. "You
know what she's doing better than her father does!" He
was walking about the little room, looking at Arthur's
pictures, photographs, and other small possessions. "Well,
you'll be coming again soon, I expect?"</p>

<p>"I expect so, if you'll have me," said Arthur, smiling.</p>

<p>Mr. Sarradet took up a photograph. "That's a nice face!"</p>

<p>"It's my mother, Mr. Sarradet."</p>

<p>"Your mother, is it? Ah, well now! And she lives at&mdash;&mdash;?
Let me see! You did mention it."</p>

<p>"At Malvern&mdash;she and my sister."</p>

<p>"Your sister? Ah, yes! Unmarried, isn't she? Have
you no other brothers or sisters?"</p>

<p>Under these questions&mdash;and more followed, eliciting a good
deal of information about his family and its circumstances&mdash;Arthur's
face gradually assumed its distinctively patient
expression. The patience was very closely akin to endurance&mdash;in
fact, to boredom. Why did the fussy old fellow worry
him like that? Instinctively he hardened himself against
Sarradet&mdash;against Sarradet's implied assertion of a right to
ask him all these questions. Perhaps he knew that this
resentment was not very reasonable. He felt it, none the
less. To put him in any way to the question, to a test or a
trial, was so entirely contrary to what had been Marie's way.</p>

<p>"And you're practising at the Bar, Mr. Lisle, eh?"</p>

<p>The infusion of obstinacy in the patience grew stronger.
"I'm what is commonly called a briefless barrister."</p>

<p>Now old Sarradet knew that&mdash;and did not mind it under
the circumstances. But the thought of that dowry was too
much for him. He could not resist a little flourish. "Briefless!
Oh, come, don't say that!" He pursed up his lips and shook
his head humorously.</p>

<p>"It's unfortunately the case, Mr. Sarradet. I hope it
won't always be so, of course."</p>

<p>"We must hope that, we must all hope that!" said
Sarradet, rubbing his hands slowly together. "And in any
case we none of us know what fortune has in store for us, do
we?" He smiled, looking at Arthur with an interrogative
air. He thought he had given the young man a lead, a good
cue on which to speak. Arthur said nothing, and Sarradet's
smile gradually vanished, being replaced by a look of some
perplexity. He did not know how to go on; Mrs. Veltheim
had told him what to do but had not told him how to do it.
There was an awkward silence. Sarradet had taken up his
hat and stood in the middle of the room, fingering it and eyeing
Arthur with an air that seemed almost furtive. "Well, I
must be going," he said at last.</p>

<p>Arthur moved towards the door of the room and opened it.
Sarradet stepped into the hall, saying, "Perhaps you'll be
looking in on us to-night?"</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, but I've arranged to go to the theatre
with a man to-night."</p>

<p>"To-morrow then?" Sarradet's tone sounded persistent.</p>

<p>Arthur had meant to look in to-morrow. It had been a
pleasant prospect. Why was the old fellow making an obligation,
a duty, of it?</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come to-morrow," he said, rather curtly.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's right, that's right!" Arthur had opened the
hall door by now. Sarradet took his hand and pressed it
hard. "That'll be good news for Marie, won't it?" He had
at last got a little nearer to what Mrs. Veltheim wanted.</p>

<p>"I'm very much flattered by your putting it like that."
Arthur was still distant and defensive.</p>

<p>But Sarradet was desperate now&mdash;he must get out what he
wanted to say before the door was shut on him. "Oh, nonsense!
Come, Mr. Lisle, as man to man, we understand one
another?"</p>

<p>The question was out at last. If he had put it a quarter
of an hour earlier, Arthur Lisle would have answered it to his
satisfaction, however little he relished its being put. But
now it was not fated to have an answer. For on the very
moment of its being put, there came interruption in a form
which made the continuance of this momentous conversation
impossible.</p>

<p>A barouche with a pair of fine bay horses, a barouche on
Cee-springs, sumptuously appointed, clattered up the street
and to the common amazement of the two men stopped at
the door. The footman sprang down from the box and,
touching his hat to a lady who occupied the carriage, waited
for her instructions. But she paid no heed to him. She
leant over the side of the carriage and looked at the two men
for a moment. Sarradet took off his hat. Arthur Lisle just
stared at the vision, at the entire vision, the lady, the carriage,
the footman&mdash;the whole of it.</p>

<p>The lady's face broke into a bright smile of recognition.</p>

<p>"I came to call on Mr. Arthur Lisle. You must be Arthur,
aren't you?" she said.</p>

<p>No, there was no possibility of Mr. Sarradet's getting his
question answered now.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h2>A TIMELY DISCOVERY</h2>


<p>When Arthur ran down the step and across the
pavement, to take the hand which his visitor
held out to him over the carriage door, Mr.
Sarradet bowed politely, put his hat on, and turned on his
heel. He was consumed with curiosity, but he had no excuse
for lingering. He walked up Bloomsbury Street and along
the east side of Bedford Square. But then, instead of pursuing
a north-westerly course towards his home, he turned sharply
to the right and, slackening his pace, strolled along Montague
Place in the direction of Russell Square. He went about
twenty yards, then turned, strolled back to the corner of
Bedford Square and peered round it. He repeated these
movements three or four times, very slowly; they consumed
perhaps six or seven minutes. His last inspection showed
the carriage still at the door, though neither the lady nor
Arthur was visible. Evidently she was paying a call, as she
had intimated; no telling how long it might last! "Well, I
must go home," thought Mr. Sarradet, as he strolled slowly
towards the east once more. He turned and walked briskly
back. Just as he reached again the corner from which he had
taken his observation, he made a sudden backward jump.
He was afraid that he was caught! For the barouche dashed
by him at a rapid trot, and in it sat the lady and Arthur
Lisle. They did not see him; their heads were turned towards
one another; they appeared to be engrossed in a lively
conversation. The carriage turned westward, across Bedford
Square; Sarradet watched it till it disappeared round the
corner into Tottenham Court Road.</p>

<p>"That's quick work!" thought Mr. Sarradet; and in
truth, if (as the visitor's words implied) she had never seen
Arthur Lisle before, the acquaintance was going forward
apace. Who could she be? He was vaguely troubled that
Arthur Lisle should have&mdash;or make&mdash;a friend like that. The
barouche somehow depressed him; perhaps it put him a
little out of conceit with the dimensions of that precious
dowry; it looked so rich. And then there had been the
reserve, the distance, in Arthur's manner, his refusal to follow
up leads and to take cues, and the final fact that the important
question had (even though it were by accident) gone unanswered.
All these things worked together to dash Mr. Sarradet's
spirits.</p>

<p>He told Marie about his visit to Arthur. She was rather
surprised at a sudden fancy like that (for so he represented it)
taking hold of him, but her suspicions were not roused. When
he went on to describe the arrival of the other visitor she
listened with natural and eager interest. But the old fellow,
full of his perplexities, made a false step.</p>

<p>"She was in the house nearly ten minutes, and then&mdash;what
do you think, Marie?&mdash;they drove away together!"</p>

<p>"In the house ten minutes? Where were you all that
time?"</p>

<p>"I was&mdash;er&mdash;strolling along."</p>

<p>"You must have strolled pretty slowly. Where did they
overtake you, Pops?"</p>

<p>He grew rather red. "I can't remember exactly&mdash;&mdash;" he
began lamely.</p>

<p>She knew him so well; his confused manner, telling that
he had something to conceal, could not escape her notice.</p>

<p>"I believe you waited round the corner to see what happened!
Why did you spy on him like that?"</p>

<p>"I don't see any particular harm in being a little curious
about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she interrupted him. His spying after the carriage
threw suspicion on his motives for his visit too. "Didn't
you really go and see Mr. Lisle about anything in particular?"</p>

<p>"Anything in particular, my dear? What do you mean?
I asked him to drop in to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you talk about me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you were mentioned, of course."</p>

<p>She leant her arm on the mantelpiece and looked down at
him gravely. He read a reproachful question in her glance,
and fidgeted under it. "Have you been meddling?" was
what her gravely enquiring eyes asked. "Meddling as well
as spying, Pops?"</p>

<p>He was roused to defend himself. "You've got no mother,
Marie, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" she murmured, as a quick flash of enlightenment
came. That was Aunt Louisa's phrase! She saw where it
came from in a minute; it had always supplied Mrs. Veltheim
with a much desired excuse for interfering. She went
on in a hard voice&mdash;she was very angry&mdash;"Did you ask Mr.
Lisle his intentions?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I&mdash;I only took the opportunity of finding
out something about his people, and&mdash;and so on. Really,
I think you're very unreasonable, Marie, to object&mdash;&mdash;"
and he wandered or maundered on about his paternal rights
and duties.</p>

<p>She let him go on. She had no more to say about it&mdash;no
more that she could say, without revealing her delicate
diplomacy. She would do that to nobody alive; she had
never stated it explicitly even to herself. There she left the
affair, left the last word and a barren show of victory to her
father. How much mischief he had done she would find out
later&mdash;perhaps to-morrow, if Arthur Lisle came. But would
he&mdash;now? It was the effect of her father's meddling she
feared, not that matter of the lady's visit. She knew that
he had other friends than themselves. Why shouldn't one
of them come and take him for a drive? It was Mrs. Norton
Ward, very likely. Her quarrel with her father about his
meddling even prevented her from asking what the visitor
was like; whatever he might do, she at least would show no
vulgar curiosity.</p>

<p>Yet it was the coincidence of the visit with the meddling
that did the mischief. Without the first, the second would
have resulted in nothing worse than a temporary annoyance,
a transitory shock to Arthur's feelings, which a few days'
time and Marie's own tact would have smoothed over. As it
was, his distaste for old Sarradet's inquisition, an angry
humiliation at having the pistol held to his head, a romantic
abhorrence of such a way of dealing with the tenderest and
most delicate matters, a hideous yet obstinate suspicion that
Marie might be privy to the proceeding&mdash;all these set his
feelings just in time for the unexpected visit.</p>

<p>The visit had been delightful, and delight is an unsettling
thing. As Mrs. Godfrey Lisle&mdash;or Bernadette, as she bade
him call her&mdash;purred about his room (so he put it to himself),
still more when she declared for sunshine and carried him
off to drive with her&mdash;in Regent's Park too!&mdash;he had felt a
sudden lift of the spirit, an exaltation and expansion of
feeling. The world seemed wider, its possibilities more various;
it was as though walls had been torn down from around him&mdash;walls
of his own choice and making, no doubt, but walls
all the same. This sensation was very vague; it was little
more than that the whole atmosphere of his existence seemed
fresher, more spacious and more pungent. He owned ruefully
that the barouche, the Cee-springs, the bay horses and
the liveries, might have had something to do with his pleasure;
he knew his susceptibility to the handsome things of material
life&mdash;the gauds and luxuries&mdash;and ever feared to catch himself
in snobbishness. But the essential matter did not lie
there; his company was responsible for that&mdash;Bernadette,
and the way she had suddenly appeared, and whisked him
off as it were on a magic carpet for a brief journey through
the heavens; it seemed all too brief.</p>

<p>"I came as soon as ever I could," she told him. "I got
Esther Norton Ward's letter about you after we'd gone to
Hilsey for Easter, and we got back only yesterday. But I
had terrible work to get leave to come. I had to go down on
my knees almost! Cousin Arthur, you're in disgrace, and
when you come to see us, you must abase yourself before
Godfrey. The Head of the House is hurt because you didn't
call!"</p>

<p>"I know. It was awfully wrong of me, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand all about it. But Godfrey's a stickler for
his rights. However Sir Oliver and I managed to bring him
round ("Who's Sir Oliver?" asked Arthur inwardly), and
when you've eaten humble pie, it will be all right. Do you
like humble pie, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"No more do I." But she was smiling still, and he thought
it was little of that stuff she would have to consume. "You
see, you made quite an impression on Esther. Oh, and Sir
Christopher came down for a week-end, and he was full of
your praises too." She put on a sudden air of gravity. "I
drove up to your door in a state of considerable excitement,
and I had a momentary fear that the fat man with the black
moustache was you. However it wasn't&mdash;so that's all right."
She did not ask who the fat man really was; Arthur was
glad&mdash;all that could come later.</p>

<p>In fact she asked him no questions about himself. She
welcomed him with the glee of a child who has found a new
toy or a new playmate. There was no hint of flirtation, no
effort to make a conquest; a thing like that seemed quite
out of her way. There was no pose, either of languor or of
gush. The admiration of his eyes, which he could not altogether
hide, she either did not notice or took as a matter of
course&mdash;something universal and therefore, from a personal
point of view, not important. On the other hand he caught
her looking at him with interest and critically. She saw
that she was caught and laughed merrily over it. "Well,
I do feel rather responsible for you, you know," she said in
self-defence.</p>

<p>Life does do funny things all of a sudden! He drove with
her past the Sarradets' house. He seemed, for the moment, a
world away from it. They drove together for an hour; they
arranged that he should come to lunch on a day to be fixed
after consultation with Godfrey&mdash;it appeared that Godfrey
liked to be consulted&mdash;and then she set him down in the
Marylebone Road. When he tried, rather stammeringly, to
thank her, she shook her head with a smile that seemed a
little wistful, saying "No, I think it's I who ought to thank
you; you've given me an afternoon's holiday&mdash;all to myself!"
She looked back over her shoulder and waved her hand to
him again as she turned down Harley Street and passed out
of sight. When she was gone, the vision of her remained with
him, but vaguely and rather elusively&mdash;a memory of grey
eyes, a smooth rich texture of skin, mobile changeable lips,
fair wavy hair&mdash;these in a setting of the richest apparel; an
impression of something very bright and very fragile, carefully
bestowed in sumptuous wrappings.</p>

<p>He went to the Sarradets' the next evening, as he had
been bidden, but he went with laggard steps. He could not
do what seemed to be expected of him there&mdash;not merely
because it was expected, though that went for something
considerable, thanks to his strain of fastidious obstinacy, but
because it had become impossible for him to&mdash;his feelings
sought a word and found only a very blunt and ungracious
one&mdash;to tie himself up like that. His great contentment was
impaired and could no longer absorb him. His sober scheme
of happiness was crumbling. His spirit was for adventure.
Finality had become suddenly odious&mdash;and marriage presents
itself as finality to those who are not yet married. If he had
not been ready for the plunge before, now he was a thousand
times less ready.</p>

<p>The evening belied the apprehensions he had of it. There
was a merry party&mdash;Mildred Quain, Amabel Osling, Joe
Halliday, and half-a-dozen other young folk. And Mr.
Sarradet was out! Dining at his club with some old cronies,
Marie explained. There were games and music, plenty of
chaff and a little horseplay. There was neither the opportunity
nor the atmosphere for sentiment or sentimental
problems. In gratitude to fate for this, and in harmony with
what was his true inward mood behind and deeper than his
perplexity, Arthur's spirits rose high; he chaffed and sported
with the merriest. Marie was easy, cordial, the best of friends
with him&mdash;not a hint of anything except just that special
and pleasant intimacy of friendship which made them something
more to one another than the rest of the company
could be to either of them. She was just as she had always
been&mdash;and he dismissed his suspicion. She had known
nothing at all of Mr. Sarradet's inquisition; she was in no
way to blame for it. And if she were innocent, why, then,
was not he innocent also? His only fault could lie in having
seemed to her to mean what he had not meant. If he had
not seemed to her to mean it, where was his fault,&mdash;and where
his obligation? But if he acquitted Marie, and was quite
disposed to acquit himself, he nursed his grudge against old
Sarradet for his bungling attempt to interfere between
friends who understood one another perfectly.</p>

<p>Marie watched him, without appearing to watch, and was
well content. Her present object was to set him completely
at his ease again&mdash;to get back to where they were before Mrs.
Veltheim interfered and her father blundered. If she could
do that, all would be well; and she thought that she was
doing it. Had Mrs. Veltheim and Mr. Sarradet been the only
factors in the case, she would probably have proved herself
right; for she was skilful and tenacious, and no delicacy of
scruple held her back from trying to get what she wanted,
even when what she wanted happened to be a man to marry.
There that toughness of hers served her ends well.</p>

<p>When he said good-night, he was so comfortable about
the whole position, so friendly to her and so conscious of the
pleasure she had given him in the last few weeks, that he said
with genuine ruefulness, "Back to the Temple to-morrow! I
shan't be able to play about so much!"</p>

<p>"No, you must work," she agreed. "But try to come and
see us now and then, when you're not too busy."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I shall&mdash;and I'm not at all likely to be
busy. Only one has to stop in that hole&mdash;just in case."</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;just when you feel like it. Don't make a duty
of it. Just when you feel inclined for a riot like this, or perhaps
for a quiet talk some afternoon."</p>

<p>This was all just what he wanted to hear, exactly how he
wanted the thing to be put.</p>

<p>Yes, but Mr. Sarradet would not always be so obliging as
to be out! The thought of Mr. Sarradet, whom he had really
forgotten, suddenly recurred to him unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"That's what I like&mdash;our quiet talks," she went on.
"But you've only to say the word, and we'll have company
for you."</p>

<p>Her tone was light, playful, chaffing. He answered in the
same vein. "I'll send my orders about that at least twelve
hours beforehand."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my lord," and, laughing, she dropped him a
curtsey.</p>

<p>He left them still at their frolic and went home rather
early. He had enjoyed himself, but, all the same, his dominant
sense was one of relief, and not merely from the obligation
which officious hands had sought to thrust on him, regardless
of the fact that he was not ready to accept it and might
never be. It was relief from the sense of something that he
himself had been doing, or been in danger of doing, to his
own life&mdash;a thing which he vaguely defined as a premature
and ignorant disposal of that priceless asset. Together with
the youthful vanity which this feeling about his life embodied,
there came to him also a moment of clear-sightedness, in the
light of which he perceived the narrow limits of his knowledge
of the world, of life, even of himself. He saw&mdash;the word is
too strong, rather he felt somehow&mdash;that he had never really
wanted Marie Sarradet to share, much less to be the greatest
factor in, that precious, still unexplored life; he had really
only wanted to talk to her about it, with her to speculate
about it, to hear from her how interesting it was and might
become. He wanted that still from her. Or at all events
from somebody? From her or another? He put that
question behind him&mdash;it was too sceptical. He wanted still
her interest, her sympathy. But he wanted something else
even more&mdash;freedom to find, to explore, to fulfil his life.</p>

<p>So it was that Mr. Arthur Lisle, by a fortunate combination
of circumstances on which he certainly had no right to
reckon, found out, just in time, that after all he had never
been in love&mdash;unless indeed with his own comely image,
flatteringly reflected in a girl's admiring eyes.</p>

<p>Poor tender diplomatist! But possibly she too might make
her own discoveries.</p>

<h2>ALL OF A FLUTTER</h2>


<p>"Bernadette's got a new toy, Esther."</p>

<p>"I know it," said Mrs. Norton Ward, handing her
visitor a cup of tea.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you know the fact or that you're
acquainted with the individual?"</p>

<p>"The latter, Judith. In fact I sent him to her."</p>

<p>"Well, it was she who went to him really, though Godfrey
made some trouble about it. He thought the young man
ought to have called first. However they got round him."</p>

<p>"They? Who?"</p>

<p>"Why, Bernadette and Oliver Wyse, of course. And he
came to lunch. But Godfrey was quite on his high horse at
first&mdash;stroked his beard, and dangled his eye-glass, and looked
the other way when he was spoken to&mdash;you know the poor
old dear when he's like that? Luckily the young man could
tell Leeds from Wedgwood, and that went a long way towards
putting matters right. Godfrey quite warmed to him at last."</p>

<p>"We like him very much, and I hope you did&mdash;even if
you won't admit it. He's got a room in Frank's chambers,
you know."</p>

<p>"I didn't speak more than six words to him&mdash;he was up
at the other end of the table by Bernadette. But I liked the
look of him rather. Of course he was all of a flutter."</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay," smiled Esther. "But I thought we ought
to risk that&mdash;and Sir Christopher felt quite strongly about
it."</p>

<p>Judith Arden appeared to reflect for a moment. "Well, I
think he ought to be," she said judicially. "I wouldn't give
much for a man who didn't get into a flutter over Bernadette,
at first anyhow. She must seem to them rather&mdash;well, irresistible."</p>

<p>"She's wonderfully"&mdash;Esther Norton Ward sought for a
word too&mdash;"radiant, I mean, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"And there isn't a bit of affectation about her. She just
really does enjoy it all awfully."</p>

<p>"All what?"</p>

<p>"Why, being irresistible and radiant, of course."</p>

<p>"That's looking at it entirely from her point of view."</p>

<p>"What point of view do you suppose she looks at it from?
That is, if she ever looks at it at all. And why not? They
ought to be able to look after themselves&mdash;or keep away."</p>

<p>"I really think you're a very fair-minded girl," laughed
Esther. "Very impartial."</p>

<p>"You have to be&mdash;living with them as much as I do."</p>

<p>"Do you like it?"</p>

<p>Judith smiled. "The situation is saved just by my not
having to do it. If I had to do it for my bread-and-butter
I should hate it like poison. But, thank heaven, I've four
hundred a year, and if I spend the summer with them, it's
because Godfrey and Margaret want me. The winter I keep
for myself&mdash;Switzerland part of the time, then Rome, or
Florence. So I'm quite independent, you see. I'm always a
visitor. Besides, of course, nobody could be more gracious
than Bernadette; graciousness is part of being irresistible."</p>

<p>"I really do think that being pretty improves people,"
said Esther.</p>

<p>"Well, as far as I can see, without it there wouldn't <i>be</i>
any Bernadette," Judith remarked, and then laughed gently
at her own extravagance. "At any rate, she'd be bound to
turn into something absolutely different. Something like me
even, perhaps!" She laughed again, a low, pleasant, soft
laugh, rather in contrast with the slightly brusque tone and the
satiric vein which marked her speech. The laugh seemed to
harmonise with and to belong to her eyes, which were dark,
steady, and reflective; the tone and manner to fall into line
with the pertness of her nose, with its little jut upwards,
and with the scornful turn of her upper lip. Her figure and
movements perhaps helped the latter impression too; she
inclined to thinness, and her gestures were quick and sometimes
impatient.</p>

<p>"Come, you're not so bad," said Esther with her pleasant
cordial candour. "Now I'm quite insignificant."</p>

<p>"No, you're not. You've got the grand manner. I heard
Godfrey say so."</p>

<p>Esther laughed both at the compliment and at the authority
vouched in support of it.</p>

<p>"Oliver Wyse was at lunch too on the occasion, was he?
How is he getting on?"</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver is still his usual agreeable, composed, competent,
and, I'm inclined to think, very wilful self."</p>

<p>"Patient, though?" The question came with a mischievous
glance. Judith's retort was ironic, both with eyes
and tongue.</p>

<p>"I permit myself any amount of comment on character
but no conjecture as to facts. That's the distinction between
studying human nature and gossiping, Esther."</p>

<p>"Don't snub me! And the distinction's rather a fine
one."</p>

<p>"No, gossip's all right for you, living outside the house.
I live so much inside it that I think it wouldn't be fair in me.
And above all, owing to the footing on which I'm there&mdash;as
I've told you&mdash;I am emphatically not a watch-dog."</p>

<p>"Where's the child?"</p>

<p>"She's down at Hilsey&mdash;with the old housekeeper Mrs.
Gates&mdash;by doctor's orders."</p>

<p>"Again! Have you any comment to make on the doctor's
character?"</p>

<p>"I think you're being malicious. It's really better for the
child to be in the country. We're very busy, all of us, and
very gay&mdash;a bustle all the time. If she were here, she'd only
be with a nurse in the Park or in the nursery. And we're only
just back from three weeks at Hilsey ourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I was being malicious," Esther admitted.
"I suppose we're all jealous of Bernadette in our hearts,
and talk like cats about her! Well, you don't!"</p>

<p>"It would be ungrateful of me. She affords me a very
great deal of pleasure. Besides, she's my aunt."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;by marriage."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, entirely by marriage," Miss Arden agreed with
one of her fleeting smiles. She implied that no other form of
auntship would be, as the advertisements say, "entertained"
by Bernadette. "And even as to that I have, by request,
dropped the titles, both for her and Godfrey," she added.</p>

<p>Though Judith Arden was only just out of her teens, she
was older in mind and ways; she ranked herself, and was
accepted, as contemporary with women in the middle and
later twenties, like Bernadette and Esther Norton Ward.
She had had to face the world practically by herself. An
epidemic of fever in an Italian town had carried off father and
mother when she was fifteen. She had got them buried, herself
quarantined and back to England, unaided, as she best
could. That was a developing experience. At home she came
under the guardianship of her uncle, Godfrey Lisle, which
was much the same thing as coming under her own. Godfrey
was not practical; the care of a growing girl was hopelessly
beyond him. Judith put herself to school at Paris; that
finished with, she tried Cambridge for a term, and found it
too like going back to school. She kept house for a while
with an old school-comrade, an art-student, in Paris. The
friend married, and she was by herself again. A visit to Hilsey
led to the sort of semi-attachment to the Godfrey Lisle
household which she described to Esther; from the position
of a "poor relation" she was saved by her four hundred
pounds a year&mdash;her mother's portion; the late Mr. Arden,
author of books on art, and travel in the interests of art,
had left nothing but some personal debts behind. To the
maturity of her world-experience there was one exception;
she had never been in love; the transitory flirtations of
ball-rooms and studios had left her amused but heart-whole.</p>

<p>Her guardian had come by degrees to let himself be looked
after by her a good deal. The inheritor of an old family
estate worth some ten thousand pounds a year, Godfrey Lisle
had been bred for a country squire, a local man of affairs, or
(given aptitude for the wider sphere) a politician; such were
the traditions of the Lisles of Hilsey. In him they found no
continuance. He was a shy quiet man, tall but rather awkward
in person, and near-sighted; his face was handsome
and refined and, when he was not embarrassed (he often was),
his manner was pleasant, if too soft. But he did not like
society, and was shy with strangers; he would fumble with
the black ribbon from which his glasses hung, and look the
other way, as Judith had described. He was fond of beautiful
things&mdash;pictures, china, furniture&mdash;but had not the energy
to make himself a real amateur of any of them. His nature
was affectionate&mdash;calmly affectionate, and the affections were
constant. Once, and once only, he had blazed into a flame
of feeling&mdash;when he courted Bernadette and in the early
days of his marriage with her. The beautiful penniless girl&mdash;she
would have stirred even a fish to romance; and it would
not have been fair to call Godfrey fish-like. But ardours
were not really in his line; too soon the rapturous lover
subsided into the affectionate husband. Bernadette had
shown no signs of noticing the change; perhaps she did not
wish to check it. It may be that it coincided with a modification
of her own feelings. At any rate, thus acquiesced in,
it had gone further. Little of affection survived now, though
they treated one another with the considerate politeness of
an extinct passion. He gave her everything that she desired&mdash;even
to the straining of his income; he was the only person
for whom she ever "put herself out." Here were reciprocal,
if tacit, apologies for a state of affairs which neither of them
really regretted.</p>

<p>She had loved him, though, once. She did not claim it as
a merit; there it was, a curious fact in her past life at which,
in her rare moments of introspection, she would smile. She
had loved not only all that he brought&mdash;ease, wealth, escape
from sordidness; she had also loved him for bringing them.
Even now sometimes she would love the memory of him as
he had seemed in those days; then the considerate politeness
would be coloured by a pretty tenderness, a sort of compassionate
affection as for a man who had fallen from high
estate, inevitably fallen but blamelessly. However these
recrudescences on the whole embarrassed Godfrey Lisle, and
Bernadette, laughing at herself, withdrew to a safe distance
and to her real interests. Godfrey was not one of the interests
of her life; he was only one of its conditions.</p>

<p>Into this household&mdash;though not, of course, below the
surface of it&mdash;Arthur Lisle now made joyful and tremulous
entry. His eyes were in no state to see clearly or to see far;
they were glued to the central light, and for him the light
burned bright to dazzling. Behold the vision that he saw&mdash;the
vision of a Reigning Beauty!</p>

<p>It is a large party. There is no getting near her&mdash;at least
no staying near. The crush forces a man away, however
politely. But perhaps a far-off corner may afford a view, for
a dexterous servant keeps clear a space just in front of her,
and the onlooker is tall. They all come and speak to her,
by ones and twos&mdash;ex-beauties, would-be beauties, rival
beauties; for the last she has a specially cordial
greeting&mdash;sometimes,
if she knows them well, a word of praise for their
gowns, always a quick approving glance at them. The great
ladies come; for them a touch of deference, a pretty humility,
a "Who am I that you should come to my house?" air,
which gracefully masks her triumphant sense of personal
power. The men come&mdash;all the young men who would adore
if they might, and are very grateful for their invitations;
they pass quickly, each with his reward of an indolent smile
of welcome. The choice young men come; them she greets
with a touch of distance lest they should grow proud in their
hearts. No favour in them to come&mdash;far from it! Then an
old man, a friend. Mark now the change; she is daughter-like
in her affection and simplicity. Then perhaps a little
stir runs through the company, a whisper, a craning of necks.
A great man is coming&mdash;for beauty can draw greatness.
There comes a massive white head&mdash;a ribbon and star perhaps,
or the plain black that gives, not wears, such ornaments.
He stays with her longer: there is no jostling now; the
dexterous servant delays the oncoming stream of guests.
Royal compliments are exchanged. It is a meeting between
Potentates.</p>

<p>In some such dazzling colours may the ardent imagination
of youth paint the quite ordinary spectacle of a pretty woman's
evening party, while an old lady on one side of him complains
that "everybody" is there, and an old man on the other
says that it is a beastly crush, or damns the draught from a
window behind him&mdash;lucky, perhaps, if he does not damn the
Potentates too, the one for keeping him from his bed, the
other for marching through rapine to dismemberment, or
some such act of policy plainly reprehensible.</p>

<p>Strange to think&mdash;it is Youth that holds the brush again&mdash;strange
and intoxicating&mdash;that this is the woman with whom
he drives in the Park, of whose family luncheon he partakes,
with whom he had tea yesterday, who makes a friend of him.
She talked to him an hour yesterday, told him all about
that hard childhood and girlhood of hers, how she had scanty
food and coarse, had to make her own frocks and wash her
own handkerchiefs; she said that she feared the hard training
had made her hard, yet hoped with a sigh that it was not so,
and seemed to leave the question to his sovereign arbitrament.
She had made the little narrow home she came from real to
him with cunning touches; she had made her leap of escape
from it so natural, so touching. Of what the leap had brought
her she had made light, had spoken with a gentle depreciation
of the place her beauty had won&mdash;"Such looks as I have
helped, I suppose, besides Godfrey's position"&mdash;and let him
see how much more to her taste was a quiet talk with a friend
than all the functions of society. How much better than the
receiving of Beauties and Potentates was a quiet hour in
the twilight of her little den with Cousin Arthur!</p>

<p>Could it be the same woman? Yes, it was. There was the
wonder and the intoxication of it. He was quite unknown to
all that throng. But to himself he stood among them,
eminent and superior. See, hadn't she thrown him a glance&mdash;right
across the room? Well, at any rate he could almost
swear she had!</p>

<p>Arthur Lisle&mdash;in the flesh at his cousin's evening party,
in the spirit anywhere you like&mdash;felt a hand laid on his arm.
He turned to find Sir Christopher Lance beside him.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Lisle, aren't you glad you took my advice? I
told you you were missing something by not coming here.
Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but you see, I didn't know&mdash;I didn't quite
understand what you meant."</p>

<p>"You might have thought it worth while to find out,"
said the old man, smiling. "As it was, I'm told you had to
be fetched."</p>

<p>Arthur laughed shamefacedly but happily. That was
already a standing joke between him and Bernadette; hence
the associations of it were altogether pleasant.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher's way was not to spoil joy in the name of
wisdom nor to preach a safety that was to be won through
cowardice. He saw the young man's excitement and exaltation,
and commended it.</p>

<p>"Take as much of this sort of thing as you can get," he
counselled, nodding his head towards the crowd and, incidentally,
towards Bernadette. "Take a good dose of the world.
It'll do you good. Society's an empty thing to people with
empty heads, but not to the rest of us. And the more you
go about, and so on&mdash;well, the fewer terrors will my Brother
Pretyman possess for you."</p>

<p>Arthur Lisle caught at the notion eagerly. "Just what
I've had in my own mind, sir," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"I thought from the look of you that you had some such
wise idea in your head," said Sir Christopher with equal
seriousness.</p>

<p>Arthur blushed, looked at him rather apprehensively, and
then laughed. The Judge remained grave, but his blue eyes
twinkled distantly. <i>O mihi praeteritos</i>&mdash;that old tag was
running in his head.</p>

<p>"It's getting late; only bores stay late at large parties.
Come and say good-night to our hostess."</p>

<p>"Do you think we might?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>Certainly he was all of a flutter, as Judith Arden said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h2>NOTHING VENTURE, NOTHING HAVE!</h2>


<p>Arthur Lisle sat in his chambers with a copy of
the current number of the Law Reports (K.B.D.)
before him and with utter discouragement in his
heart. This mood was apt to seize him in the mornings, after
the nights of gaiety which (obeying Mr. Justice Lance's
advice) he eagerly sought. To-day it was intensified by the
fact that Bernadette had gone to Paris for a fortnight. She
bade him an affectionate, almost a tender, farewell, but she
went, and was obviously glad to go. Though he asked nothing
from her except to let herself be adored with a dog-like
adoration, a shamefaced wonder that she should be so glad
to go hid in his heart; mightn't she feel the loss of the adoration
just a little more? However there it was. And he had
nothing to do. Also he was hard up. The men he met at
his parties had things to do and were doing them&mdash;interesting
things that they could talk to women about, things they were
actually doing, not mere hopes and dreams (such as had,
not so long ago, been good enough to talk to Marie Sarradet
about). They were making their marks, or, at least, some
money. Talking of money, it was annoying, indeed humiliating,
not being able to ask Bernadette to lunch at the resorts
and in the style to which she was accustomed. He had done
this once, and the same afternoon had suddenly been confronted
with an appalling shininess in the back of his dress-coat;
the price of the lunch would pretty well have paid for
a new coat. But there&mdash;if you gave parties you could not
have new coats; and what was the good of new coats unless
you could give parties? A vicious circle!</p>

<p>Stagnation! That was what his life was&mdash;absolute stagnation.
No avenues opened, there were no prospects. Stagnation
and Vacancy&mdash;that's what it was!</p>

<p>A strange contrast is this to the young man at the evening
party? Nay, no contrast at all, but just the other side of
him, the complement of the mood which had pictured Potentates
and thrilled over the Reigning Beauty. The more
ardently youth gives one hand to hope, the more fiercely
despair clutches the other.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;even as Martin Luther flung his inkpot at
Satan&mdash;Arthur Lisle with an oath seized the Law Reports
(K.B.D.) and hurled them violently from him&mdash;across the
room, with all his force, at this Demon of Stagnation and towards
the door which happened to be opposite. They struck&mdash;not
the door&mdash;but the waistcoat of Henry who at that
moment opened it. Henry jumped in amazement.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, Henry. It slipped from my hand,"
said Arthur, grinning in ill-tempered mirth.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought no other gentleman was with you,"
remarked Henry, whose ideas of why one should throw books
about were obviously limited. "A Mr. Halliday is here, sir,
and wants to know if you'll see him."</p>

<p>"Of course I will. Show him in directly." As Henry went
out, Arthur ejaculated the word "Good!"</p>

<p>Anybody would have been welcome&mdash;even Luther's
Antagonist himself, perhaps&mdash;to Arthur in that black mood
of his. Joe Halliday was a godsend. He carried cheerfulness
with him&mdash;not of the order commended by moralists and
bred by patience out of trouble, but rather a spontaneous
hilarity of mind, thanks to which he derided the chances of
life, and paddled his canoe with a laugh through the rapids
of fortune. Joe had no settled means and he scorned any
settled occupation. He preferred to juggle with half a
dozen projects, keeping all of them in the air at once. He
had something to sell and something to buy, something to
find or something to get rid of; something had just been
invented, or was just going to be; somebody needed money
or somebody had it to invest. And all the Somebodies and
Somethings were supposed to pay a toll to Joe for interesting
himself in the matter. Generally they did; when they
failed to, he paddled gaily on to another venture&mdash;Cantabat
vacuus. But on the whole he was successful. The profits,
the commissions, the "turns" came rolling in&mdash;and were
rolled out again with a festive and joyous prodigality that
took no thought for a morrow which, under the guidance of
an acute and sanguine intelligence, should not have the
smallest difficulty in providing for itself.</p>

<p>He bustled in and threw his hat on Arthur's table. "Morning,
old chap. Sorry to interrupt! I expect you're awfully
busy? Yes, I see! I see! Look at the briefs! Mr. Arthur
Lisle&mdash;with you the Right Hon. Sir Richard Finlayson,
<span class="smcap">k.c., m.p.</span>&mdash;300 guineas! Whew! Mr. Arthur Lisle&mdash;With
you&mdash;&mdash;" He fingered the imaginary briefs, rolling his
eyes at Arthur, and scratching his big hooked nose with
the other hand.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil, Joe," said Arthur, smiling, suddenly
able to smile, at the Demon of Stagnation as represented by
his empty table. "Have a cigarette?"</p>

<p>"The subject of my call demands a pipe," and he proceeded
to light one. "Have you got any money, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"I think you're roughly acquainted with the extent of my
princely income."</p>

<p>"Income isn't money. Capital is. Turn your income
into capital, and you've got money!"</p>

<p>"It sounds delightfully simple, and must work well&mdash;for a
time, Joe."</p>

<p>"I've got a real good thing. No difficulty, no risk&mdash;well,
none to speak of. I thought you might like to consider it.
I'm letting my friends have the first chance."</p>

<p>"What is it? Gold, rubber, or a new fastener for umbrellas?"
Arthur was not a stranger to Joe's variegated ventures.</p>

<p>"It's a deal safer than any of those. Did you ever see
<i>Help Me Out Quickly</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I saw it at Worcester once. Quite funny!"</p>

<p>"Well, a fellow who put five hundred into <i>Help Me Out
Quickly</i> drew seventeen thousand in eighteen months and is
living on it still. Arthur, I've found a farce compared to
which <i>Help Me Out Quickly</i> is like the Dead March in Saul
played by the vicar's wife on a harmonium."</p>

<p>"And you want money to produce it?"</p>

<p>"That's the idea. Two thousand or, if possible, two
thousand five hundred. We could get the Burlington in the
autumn&mdash;first-rate theatre. Lots of fun, and mints of money!
The thing only wants seeing, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"What's the use of talking to me, Joe? I haven't got&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We're all of us going in&mdash;quite a family affair! Raymond's
in it, and old Pa Sarradet has put a bit in for Marie.
And Mildred's governor has come in; and Amabel has begged
a pony of her governor, and put it in&mdash;just for a lark, you
know. I'm in&mdash;shirt, and boots, and all. We're all in&mdash;well,
except Sidney. That chap's got no spunk."</p>

<p>The inference about Arthur, if he did not "come in," was
sadly obvious to himself, though Joe had not in the least
meant to convey it. But that did not much affect him. The
idea itself filled him with a sudden, a delicious, tingle of excitement.
Lots of fun and mints of money! Could there be a
programme more attractive? Vacancy and Stagnation could
not live in the presence of that.</p>

<p>"Just for curiosity&mdash;how much more do you want, to make
it up?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"A thousand." Joe laughed. "Oh, I'm not asking you
to put down all that. Just what you like. Only the more
that goes in, the more comes out." He laughed again joyfully;
his prophetic eyes were already beholding the stream of
gold; he seemed to dip that beak of his in it and to drink
deep.</p>

<p>Arthur knew what his income was only too well&mdash;also what
was his present balance at the bank. But, of course, his
balance at the bank (twenty-six pounds odd) had nothing
to do with the matter. His mind ran back to <i>Help Me Out
Quickly</i>. How Mother, and Anna, and he had laughed over
it at Worcester! One or two of the "gags" in it were household
words among them at Malvern to this day. Now
Joe's farce was much, much funnier than <i>Help Me Out
Quickly</i>.</p>

<p>"I know just the girl for it too," said Joe. "Quite young,
awfully pretty, and a discovery of my own."</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>Joe looked apologetic. "Awfully sorry, old fellow, but
the fact is we're keeping that to ourselves for the present.
Of course, if you came in, it'd be different."</p>

<p>The Law Reports still lay on the floor; Joe Halliday sat
on the table&mdash;Sacred Love and Profane, Stern Duty and
Alluring Venture.</p>

<p>"I'm putting up five hundred. Be a sport, and cover it!"
said Joe.</p>

<p>Something in Arthur Lisle leapt to a tremendous decision&mdash;a
wild throw with Fortune. "You can put me down for the
thousand you want, Joe," he said in quite a calm voice.</p>

<p>"Christopher!" Joe ejaculated in amazed admiration.
Then a scruple, a twinge of remorse, seized him for a moment.
"That's pretty steep, old chap&mdash;and nothing's an absolute
cert!" Temperament triumphed. "Though if there's one
on God's earth we've got it!"</p>

<p>"In for a penny, in for a pound! Nothing venture, nothing
have!" cried Arthur, feeling wonderfully gleeful.</p>

<p>"But, I say, wouldn't you like to read it first?" Conscience's
expiring spark!</p>

<p>"I'd sooner trust your opinion than my own. I may read
it later on, but I'll put down my money first."</p>

<p>"Well, I call you a sport!" Joe was moved and put out
his hand. "Well, here's luck to us!"</p>

<p>Arthur had plunged into deep water, but it did not feel
cold. He suffered no reaction of fear or remorse. He was
buoyant of spirit. Life was alive again.</p>

<p>"Of course I shall have to sell out. I haven't the cash by
me," he said, smiling at the idea. The cash by him indeed!
The cash that ought to keep him, if need be, for six or seven
years, pretty near a quarter of all he had in the world, representing
the like important fraction of his already inadequate
income. Why, now the income would be hopelessly inadequate!
His mind was moving quickly. What's the use of
trying to live on an inadequate income? While Joe was yet
in the room, Arthur formed another resolution&mdash;to realise
and spend, besides Joe's thousand (as his thoughts called it),
another five hundred pounds of his money. "By the time
that's gone," said the rapidly moving mind, "either I shall
have made something or I shall have to chuck this&mdash;and thank
heaven for it!"</p>

<p>But all this while, notwithstanding his seething thoughts,
he seemed very calm, gently inhaling his cigarette smoke.
Joe thought him the finest variety of "sport"&mdash;the deadly
cool plunger. But he also thought that his friend must be at
least a little better off than he had hitherto supposed&mdash;not
that he himself, having the same means as Arthur, would not
have risked as much and more without a qualm. But that
was his temper and way of living; he had never credited
Arthur with any such characteristics. However his admiration
remained substantially unchanged; many fellows with
tons of money had no spunk.</p>

<p>"May I tell them in Regent's Park?" he asked. "It'll
make 'em all sit up."</p>

<p>"Tell them I'm in with you, but not for how much."</p>

<p>"I shall let 'em know you've done it handsome."</p>

<p>"If you like!" laughed Arthur. "How are they? I
haven't seen them just lately."</p>

<p>"They're all right. You have been a bit of an absentee,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I must go one day soon. I say, Joe, who are your
stockbrokers?"</p>

<p>Joe supplied him with the name of his firm, and then began
to go. But what with his admiration of Arthur, and his
enthusiasm for the farce, and the beauty and talent of the
girl he had discovered, it was, or seemed, quite a long time
before he could be got out of the room. Arthur wanted him
to go, and listened to all his transports with superficial attention;
his real mind was elsewhere. At last Joe did go&mdash;triumphant
to the end, already fingering thousands just as, on his
entrance, he had so facetiously fingered Arthur's imaginary
briefs. Arthur was left alone with the Law Reports&mdash;still
on the floor where they had fallen in rebound from Henry's
waistcoat. Let them lie! If they had not received notice to
quit, they had at least been put very much on their good
behaviour. "Prove you're of some use, or out you go!"&mdash;Arthur
had delivered to them his ultimatum.</p>

<p>So much, then, for his Stern Mistress the Law&mdash;for her who
arrogated the right to exact so much and in return gave
nothing, who claimed all his days only to consume them in
weary waiting, who ate up so much of his means with her
inexorable expenses. She had tried to appease him by
dangling before his eyes the uncertain distant prospect that
in the space of years&mdash;some great, almost impossible, number
of years&mdash;he would be prosperous&mdash;that he would be even as
Norton Ward was, with briefs rolling in, "silk" in view,
perhaps a candidature. It seemed all very remote to Arthur's
new impatience. He set his mistress a time-limit. If within
the time that it took him to spend that five hundred pounds&mdash;he
did not decide definitely how long it would be&mdash;she did
something to redeem her promises, well and good, he would
be prepared to give her a further trial. If not, he would be
take himself, with his diminished income, to fresh woods
and pastures new, lying over the Back of Beyond in some
region unexplored and therefore presumed to be fertile and
attractive. He would indeed have no choice about the matter,
since the diminished income would no longer meet her exactions,
and yet enable him to live. A break with the Stern,
and hitherto ungrateful, Mistress would be a matter of compulsion.
He was very glad of it.</p>

<p>What of that other&mdash;the Mistress of his Fancy, delicate
sumptuous Cousin Bernadette? Vaguely, yet with a true
instinct, he felt that she was at the back of this mood of his
and the impulses it inspired. She was the ultimate cause,
Joe Halliday's sanguine suggestions but the occasion. Had
he not outbid Joe's daring with a greater of his own? She
it was who had stirred him to discontent, be it divine or a
work of the Devil's; she it was who braved him to his ventures.
She showed him the kingdoms of the world and the glory of
them&mdash;or, at least, very tempting glimpses thereof; would
she not herself be his guide through them, conferring on them
thereby a greater glory? In return he was ready enough to
fall down and worship, asking for himself nothing but leave
to kneel in the precincts of the shrine, not touching so much
as the hem of her garment.</p>

<p>In response to her beauty, her splendour, the treasure of
her comradeship, he offered a devotion as humble and unselfish
as it was ardent. But he burned to have an offering
to lay at her feet&mdash;a venture achieved, the guerdon of a tournament.
The smaller vanities worked with these high-flying
sentiments. For her sake he would be comely and well-equipped,
point-de-vice in his accoutrements; not a poor
relation, client, or parasite, but a man of the world&mdash;a man
of her world&mdash;on equal terms with others in it, however immeasurably
below herself. If she thought him worthy of
her favour, others must think him worthy too; to which
end he must cut a proper figure. And that speedily; for a
horrible little fiend, a little fiend clever at pricking young
men's vanity to the quick, had whispered in his ear that,
if he went shabby and betrayed a lack of ready cash, Cousin
Bernadette might smile&mdash;or be ashamed. Adoration must
not have her soaring wings clipped by a vile Economy.</p>

<p>All these things had been surging in him&mdash;confusedly but
to the point of despair&mdash;when he threw the Law Reports
across the room and hit Henry in the waistcoat; he had
seemed caught hopelessly in his vicious circle, victim beyond
help to the Demon of Stagnation. Not so strange, then, his
leap for life and freedom, not so mad could seem the risks he
took. Joe Halliday had come at a moment divinely happy for
his purpose, and had found an audacity greater than his
own, the audacity of desperation. Arthur himself wondered
not at all at what he had done. But he admired himself for
having done it, and was deliciously excited.</p>

<p>Before he left the Temple&mdash;and he left that day for good
at one o'clock, being by no means in the mood to resume the
Law Reports&mdash;he wrote two letters. One was to the firm
whose name Joe had given him; it requested them to dispose
of so much of his patrimony as would produce the sum of
fifteen hundred pounds. The other was to his mother. Since
it contained some observations on his position and prospects,
an extract from it may usefully be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since I last wrote, I have been considering what is the
wisest thing to do with regard to the Bar. No work has
appeared yet. Of course it's early days and I am not going
to be discouraged too easily. The trouble is that my necessary
expenses are heavier than I anticipated; chambers,
clerk, circuit, etc., eat into my income sadly, and even with
the strictest economy it will, I'm afraid, be necessary to encroach
on my capital. I have always been prepared to do
this to some extent, regarding it as bread cast upon the waters,
but it clearly would not be wise to carry the process too far.
I must not exhaust my present resources unless my prospects
clearly warrant it. Of course I shall come to no hasty decision;
we can talk it all over when I'm with you in the summer.
But unless some prospects do appear within a reasonable
time, I should be disposed to turn to something else while
I still have enough capital to secure an opening." ... "You
were quite right, dear Mother, about my calling on the Godfrey
Lisles, and I was quite wrong&mdash;as usual! I'm ever so glad
I've made friends with them at last. They are both delightful
people, and they've got a charming house. I've been to
several parties there, and have met people who ask me to
other houses, so I'm getting quite gay. Cousin Godfrey is
quiet and reserved, but very kind. Cousin Bernadette is
really awfully pretty and jolly, and always seems glad to see
me. She says she's going to launch me in society! I don't
object, only, again, it all costs money. Well, I think it's
worth a little, don't you?"</p>

<p>And there was a postscript: "Don't worry over what I've
said about money. I'm all right for the present, and&mdash;<i>between
ourselves</i>&mdash;I've already something in view&mdash;apart
from the Bar&mdash;which is quite promising."</p>

<p>"What a wise, prudent, thoughtful boy it is!" said the
proud mother.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h2>A COMPLICATION</h2>


<p>Bernadette Lisle's foray on the shops of Paris,
undertaken in preparation for the London season,
was of so extensive an order as to leave her hardly
an hour of the day to herself; and in the evenings the friends
with whom she was staying&mdash;Mrs. and Miss Stacey Jenkinson,
Europeanised Americans and most popular people&mdash;insisted
on her society. So it was with the greatest difficulty that she
had at last got away by herself and was able to come to lunch.</p>

<p>"Though even now," she told Oliver Wyse, as they sat
down together at the CafÃ© de Paris, "it's a secret assignation.
I'm supposed to be trying on hats!"</p>

<p>"All the sweeter for secrecy, and I suppose we're not
visible to more than two hundred people."</p>

<p>He had a fine voice, not loud but full and resonant. There
were many things about him that Bernadette liked&mdash;his composure,
his air of being equal to all things, his face and hands
browned by the sun in southern climes, his keen eyes quickly
taking in a character or apprehending a mood. But most
of all to her fancy was his voice. She told him so now with
her usual naturalness.</p>

<p>"It is pleasant to hear your voice again." She gave him
a quick merry glance. "Do you mind my saying that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hate compliments."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." She was chaffing him, but she did it with a
subtle little touch of deference, quite unlike anything in her
manner towards either her husband or her new toy, Cousin
Arthur. In this again she was, while pretty, natural. Oliver
Wyse was a dozen years her senior, and a distinguished man.
He had a career behind him in the Colonial Service, a career
of note, and was supposed to have another still in front of
him in the directorate of a great business with world-wide
interests. To take up this new work&mdash;very congenial and
promising much wealth, which had not hitherto come his
way&mdash;he had bade farewell to employment under Government.
Some said his resignation had been hailed with relief
since he did not count among his many virtues that of being
a very docile subordinate. His representations were apt to be
more energetic, his interpretation of orders less literal, than
official superiors at the other end of the cable desired. So
with many compliments and a Knight Commandership of the
appropriate Order he was gracefully suffered to depart.</p>

<p>"But a jolly little lunch like this is worth a lot of meetings
at squashes and so on, isn't it? By the way, you didn't
come to mine the other day, Sir Oliver." (She referred to
the party which Mr. Arthur Lisle had attended.)</p>

<p>"I don't like squashes."</p>

<p>"Compliments and squashes! Anything else? I want to
know what to avoid, please." She rested her chin on her
hand and looked at him with an air of wondering how far she
could safely go in her banter.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure I like handsome young cousins very
much."</p>

<p>"I haven't any more&mdash;at least I'm afraid not! Even Arthur
was quite a surprise. I believe I should never have known of
him but for Esther Norton Ward."</p>

<p>"Meddling woman! For a fortnight after his appearance
I was obviously <i>de trop</i>."</p>

<p>"I was afraid he'd run away again; he's very timid. I
had to tie him tight at first."</p>

<p>"Suppose I had run away? You don't seem to have
thought of that."</p>

<p>Her changeful lips pouted a little. "I might run after
you, I shouldn't after Arthur&mdash;and then I could bring you
back. At least, could I, Sir Oliver? Oh, dear, I've very
nearly paid you another compliment!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mind that one so much. It was more subtle."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you mind them a bit, so long as they're&mdash;well,
ingenious enough. You've been spoilt by Begums, or
Ranees, or whatever they're called, I expect."</p>

<p>"That's true. You must find me very hard to please, of
course."</p>

<p>"Well, there's a&mdash;a considering look in your eyes sometimes
that I don't quite like," said Bernadette. She laughed,
sipped her wine, and turned to her cutlet with good appetite.</p>

<p>She spoke lightly, jestingly, but she laid her finger shrewdly
on the spot. She charmed him, but she puzzled him too;
and Oliver Wyse, when he did not understand, was apt to be
angry, or at least impatient. A man of action and of ardour,
of strong convictions and feelings, he could make no terms
with people who were indifferent to the things he believed in
and was moved by, and who ordered their lives&mdash;or let them
drift&mdash;along lines which seemed to him wrong or futile. He
was a proselytiser, and might have been, in other days, a
persecutor. Not to share his views and ideals was a blunder
bordering on a crime. Even not to be the sort of man that
he was constituted an offence, since he was the sort of man of
whom the Empire and the World had need. Of this offence
Godfrey Lisle was guilty in the most heinous degree. He was
quite indifferent to all Oliver's causes&mdash;to the Empire, to
the World, to a man's duty towards these great entities;
he drifted through life in a hazy Ã¦stheticism, doing nothing,
being profoundly futile. His amiability and faithful affections
availed nothing to save him from condemnation&mdash;old
maids' virtues, both of them! Where were his feelings?
Had he no passion in him? A poor, poor creature, but half a
man, more like a pussy-cat, a well-fed old pussy-cat that
basks before the fire and lets itself be stroked, too lazy to
catch mice or mingle in affrays at midnight. An old house-cat,
truly and properly contemptible!</p>

<p>But inoffensive? No, not to Oliver's temper. Distinctly
an offence on public and general grounds, a person of evil
example, anathema by Oliver's gospel&mdash;and a more grievous
offender in that, being what he was, he was Bernadette's
husband. What a fate for her! What a waste of her!
What emptiness for mind and heart must lie in existence
with such a creature&mdash;it was like living in a vacuum! Her
nature must be starved, her capacities in danger of being
stunted. Surely she must be supremely unhappy?</p>

<p>But to all appearances she was not at all unhappy. Here
came the puzzle which brought that "considering look" into
his eyes and tinged it with resentment, even while he watched
with delight the manifold graces of her gaiety.</p>

<p>If she were content, why not leave her alone? That would
not do for Oliver. She attracted him, she charmed his
senses. Then she must be of his mind, must see and feel
things as he did. If he was bitterly discontented for her, she
must be bitterly discontented for herself. If he refused to
acquiesce in a stunted life for her, to her too the stunted life
must seem intolerable. Otherwise what conclusion was there
save that the fair body held a mean spirit? The fair body
charmed him too much to let him accept that conclusion.</p>

<p>"Enjoying your holiday from home cares?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm enjoying myself, but I haven't many home cares,
Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"Your husband must miss you very much."</p>

<p>She looked a little pettish. "Why do you say just the
opposite of what you mean? You've seen enough of us to
know that Godfrey doesn't miss me at all; he has his own
interests. I couldn't keep that a secret from you, even if I
wanted to; and I don't particularly want. You're about
my greatest friend and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About?"</p>

<p>"Well, my greatest then&mdash;and don't look as if somebody
had stolen your umbrella."</p>

<p>He broke into a laugh for an instant, but was soon grave
again. She smiled at him appealingly; she had been happier
in the light banter with which they had begun. That she
thoroughly enjoyed; it told her of his admiration, and
flattered her with it; she was proud of the friendship it implied.
When he grew serious and looked at her ponderingly,
she always felt a little afraid; and he had been doing it
more and more every time they met lately. It was as though
he were thinking of putting some question to her&mdash;some grave
question to which she must make answer. She did not want
that question put. Things were very well as they stood;
there were drawbacks, but she was not conscious of anything
very seriously wrong. She found a great deal of pleasure and
happiness in life; there were endless small gratifications
in it, and only a few rubs, to which she had become pretty
well accustomed. Inside the fair body there was a reasonable
little mind, quite ready for reasonable compromises.</p>

<p>They had finished their meal, which Bernadette at least
had thoroughly appreciated. She lit a tiny cigarette and
watched her companion; he had fallen into silence over his
cigar. His lined bronzed face looked thoughtful and worried.</p>

<p>"Oh, you think too much," she told him, touching his
hand for an instant lightly. "Why don't you just enjoy
yourself? At any rate when you're lunching with a friend
you like!"</p>

<p>"It's just because I like the friend that I think so much."</p>

<p>"But what is there to think so much about?" she cried,
really rather impatiently.</p>

<p>"There's the fact that I'm in love with you to think
about," he answered quietly. It was not a question, but it
was just as disconcerting as the most searching interrogatory;
perhaps indeed it differed only in form from one.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she murmured half under her breath, with a
frown and a pout. Then came a quick persuasive smile. "Oh,
no, you're not! I daresay you think me pretty and so on,
but you're not in love." She ventured further&mdash;so far as a
laugh. "You haven't time for it, Sir Oliver!"</p>

<p>He laughed too. "I've managed to squeeze it in, I'm afraid,
Bernadette."</p>

<p>"Can't you manage to squeeze it out again? Won't you
try?"</p>

<p>"Why should I? It suits me very well where it is."</p>

<p>She made a little helpless gesture with her hands, as if to
say, "What's to be done about it?"</p>

<p>"You're not angry with me for mentioning the fact?"</p>

<p>"Angry? No. I like you, you see. But what's the
use?"</p>

<p>He looked her full in the eyes for a moment. "We shall
have to discuss that later."</p>

<p>"What's the use of discussing? You can't discuss Godfrey
out of existence!"</p>

<p>"Not out of existence&mdash;practically speaking?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Nonsense! Of course not!" She was genuinely
vexed and troubled now.</p>

<p>"All right. Don't fret," he said, smiling. "It can wait."</p>

<p>She looked at him gravely, her lips just parted. "You do
complicate things!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"You'd rather I'd held my tongue about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would&mdash;much."</p>

<p>"I couldn't, you see, any longer. I've been wanting to
say it for six months. Besides, I think I'm the sort of fellow
who's bound to have a thing like that out and see what comes
of it&mdash;follow it to the end, you know."</p>

<p>She thought that he probably was; there lay the trouble.
The thing itself was pleasant enough to her, but she did not
want to follow it out. If only he would have left it where it
was&mdash;under the surface, a pleasant sub-consciousness for them
both, blending with their friendship a delightful sentiment!
Dragged into the open like this, it was very hard to deal
with.</p>

<p>"Can't you try and forget about it?" she whispered softly.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear!" he muttered, laughing in a mixture of
amusement and exasperation.</p>

<p>She understood something of what his tone and his laugh
meant. She gave him a quick little nod of sympathy. "Is
it as bad as that? Then my question was stupid," she seemed
to say. But though she understood, she had no suggestion
to offer. She sat with her brows furrowed and her lips pursed
up, thoroughly outfaced by the difficulty.</p>

<p>"You go back home to-morrow, don't you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. And you?"</p>

<p>"In a few days. I've not quite finished my business. Do
you want me to come to the house as usual?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," she answered quickly, her brow clearing.</p>

<p>"In the hope that I shall get over it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I shan't, you know."</p>

<p>"You can never tell. Godfrey was in love with me once.
I was in love with him too." Her expression plainly added
what her lips refrained from: "Isn't that funny?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, in refusal to consider so distasteful
a subject. Her mind appeared to dwell on it a little,
for she sat smiling reflectively. She had recovered quickly
from her alarmed discomfort; in fact she seemed so at ease,
so tranquil, that he was prompted to say&mdash;saying it, however,
with a smile&mdash;"I didn't introduce the topic just to pass the
time after lunch, you know." He paused and then added
gravely but simply, "I want you to look back on this as the
greatest day in your life."</p>

<p>Ever so slightly she shook her head. The room was nearly
empty now; the few who lingered were no less absorbed
than themselves. He put his hand on the top of her right
hand on the table. "There's my pledge for life and all I'm
worth&mdash;if you will," he said.</p>

<p>At this she seemed moved by some feeling stronger than
mere embarrassment or discomfort. She gave a little shiver
and raised her eyes to his with a murmured "Don't!" It
was as though she now, for the first time, realised to some
extent not only what he meant but what he felt, and that
the realisation caused her a deeper alarm. She sighed as
though under some weight and now, also for the first time,
blushed brightly. But when they were going to the door, she
put her arm inside his for a moment, and gave him a friendly
little squeeze. When he looked round into her face, she
laughed rather nervously. "We're dear friends, anyhow,"
she said. "You can walk with me to my hat shop, if you
like."</p>

<p>"I won't come in," he protested, in a masculine horror that
she liked.</p>

<p>"Nobody asked you. I expect to find Laura Jenkinson
waiting for me there. As it's your fault I'm so late, she'd be
very cross with you."</p>

<p>They walked up the street together in silence for a little
way. Then his attention was caught by a wonderful gown
in a shop-window and he turned to her to point it out, with a
laugh; he had determined to press her no further that day.
To his surprise he saw that her eyes were dim; a tear trickled
down her cheek.</p>

<p>"Why, Bernadette&mdash;&mdash;!" he began in shocked remorse.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she interrupted petulantly. "Well, you
frightened me. I'm&mdash;I'm not used to things like that."
Then she too saw the startling frock. "Look at that, Sir
Oliver! I don't believe I should ever dare to wear it!"</p>

<p>"I fancy it's meant to appeal to ladies of another sort."</p>

<p>"Is it? Don't they wear just what we do? Well, just a
little more so, perhaps!" She stood eyeing the gown with
a whimsical smile. "It is rather naughty, isn't it?" She
moved on again. He watched her face now. She had wiped
away the tear, no more came; she was smiling, not brightly,
but yet with a pensive amusement. Presently she asked him
a question.</p>

<p>"By what you said there&mdash;in the cafÃ©, you know&mdash;did you
mean that you wanted me to run away with you?"</p>

<p>He was rather surprised at her returning to the subject.
"I meant that I wanted to take you away with me. There'd
be no running about it."</p>

<p>"What, to do it,&mdash;openly?"</p>

<p>"Anything else wouldn't be at all according to my ideas.
Still&mdash;&mdash;" He shrugged his shoulders again; he was not
sure whether, under stress of temptation, he would succeed
in holding to his point.</p>

<p>She began to laugh, but stopped hastily when she saw
that he looked angry. "Oh, but you are absurd, you really
are," she told him in a gentle soothing fashion.</p>

<p>"I don't see that anybody could call it absurd," he remarked,
frowning. "Some good folk would no doubt call it very
wicked."</p>

<p>"Well, I should, for one," said Bernadette, "if that's of
any importance."</p>

<p>She made him laugh again, as she generally could. "I
believe I could convince you, if that's the obstacle," he began.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it is really&mdash;not the only one anyhow.
Oh, here's the shop!"</p>

<p>She stopped, but did not give him her hand directly. She
was smiling, but her eyes seemed large with alarm and apprehension.</p>

<p>"I do wish you'd promise me never to say another word
about this." There was no doubt of her almost pitiful sincerity.
It made him very remorseful.</p>

<p>"I wish to God I could, Bernadette," he answered.</p>

<p>"You're very strong. You can," she whispered, her face
upturned to his.</p>

<p>He shook his head; now her eyes expressed a sort of wonder,
as if at something beyond her understanding. "I'm very
sorry," he muttered in compunction.</p>

<p>She sighed, but gave him her hand with a friendly smile.
"No, don't be unhappy about it&mdash;about having told me, I
mean. I expect you couldn't help it. <i>Au revoir</i>&mdash;in London!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't we dine, or go to the play, or something, to-night?"
It was hard to let her out of his sight.</p>

<p>"I'm engaged, and&mdash;&mdash;" She clasped her hands for a
moment as though in supplication. "Please not, Oliver!"
she pleaded.</p>

<p>He drew back a little, taking off his hat. Her cheeks were
glowing again as she turned away and went into the shop.</p>

<h2>THE HERO OF THE EVENING</h2>


<p>That same afternoon&mdash;the day before Bernadette was
to return from Paris&mdash;Marie Sarradet telephoned to
Arthur asking him to drop in after dinner, if he were
free; besides old friends, a very important personage was to be
there, Mr. Claud Beverley, the author of the wonderfully funny
farce; Marie named him with a thrill in her voice which even
the telephone could not entirely smother. Arthur was thrilled
too, though it did cross his mind that Mr. Claud Beverley must
have rechristened himself; authors seldom succeed in achieving
such suitable names as that by the normal means. Though
he was still afraid of Mr. Sarradet and still a little embarrassed
about Marie herself, he determined to go. He put on one of
his new evening shirts&mdash;with pleats down the front&mdash;and one
of his new white evening waistcoats, which was of extremely
fashionable cut, and sported buttons somewhat out of the
ordinary; these were the first products of the five hundred
pounds venture. He looked, and felt, very well turned-out.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Sarradet was there this time, and he was grumpy.
Marie seized a chance to whisper that her father was "put
out" because Raymond had left business early to go to a
race-meeting and had not come back yet&mdash;though obviously
the races could not still be going on. Arthur doubted whether
this were the whole explanation; the old fellow seemed to
treat him with a distance and a politeness in which something
ironical might be detected; his glance at the white waistcoat
did not look wholly like one of honest admiration. Marie
too, though as kind and cordial as possible, was perhaps a
shade less intimate, less at ease with him; any possible sign
of appropriating him to herself was carefully avoided; she
shared him, almost ostentatiously, with the other girls,
Amabel and Mildred. Any difference in Marie's demeanour
touched his conscience on the raw; the ingenious argument
by which he had sought to acquit himself was not quite proof
against that.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, could seriously impair the interest and
excitement of the occasion. They clustered round Mr. Beverley;
Joe Halliday saw to that, exploiting his hero for all he
was worth. The author was tall, gaunt, and solemn-faced.
Arthur's heart sank at the first sight of him&mdash;could he really
write anything funny? But he remembered that humorists
were said to be generally melancholy men, and took courage.
Mr. Beverley stood leaning against the mantelpiece, receiving
admiration and consuming a good deal of the champagne
which had been produced in his special honour. Joe Halliday
presented Arthur to him with considerable ceremony.</p>

<p>"Now we're all here!" said Joe. "For I don't mind telling
you, Beverley, that without Lisle's help we should be a long
way from&mdash;from&mdash;well, from standing where we do at present."</p>

<p>Arthur felt that some of the limelight&mdash;to use a metaphor
appropriately theatrical&mdash;was falling on him. "Oh, that's
nothing! Anything I could afford&mdash;awfully glad to have the
chance," he murmured, rather confusedly.</p>

<p>"And he did afford something pretty considerable," added
Joe, admiringly.</p>

<p>"Of course I can't guarantee success. You know what the
theatre is," said Mr. Beverley.</p>

<p>They knew nothing about it&mdash;and even Mr. Beverley
himself had not yet made his bow to the public; but they all
nodded their heads wisely.</p>

<p>"I do wish you would tell us something about it, Mr.
Beverley," said impulsive Amabel.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I should be afraid of letting it out!" cried
Mildred.</p>

<p>"The fact is, you can't be too careful," said Joe. "There
are fellows who make a business of finding out about forthcoming
plays and stealing the ideas. Aren't there, Beverley?"</p>

<p>"More than you might think," said Mr. Beverley.</p>

<p>"I much prefer to be told nothing about it," Marie declared,
smiling. "I think that makes it ever so much more
exciting."</p>

<p>"I recollect a friend of mine&mdash;in the furniture line&mdash;thirty
years ago it must be&mdash;taking me in with him to see a rehearsal
once at the&mdash;Now, let's see, what was the theatre? A rehearsal
of&mdash;tut&mdash;Now, what was the play?" Old Mr.
Sarradet was trying to contribute to the occasion, but the tide
of conversation overwhelmed his halting reminiscences.</p>

<p>"But how do you get the idea, Mr. Beverley?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, that may come just at any minute&mdash;anywhere,
you know."</p>

<p>"Where did this one come?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I got this one, as it happens, walking on Hampstead
Heath."</p>

<p>"Hampstead Heath! Fancy!" breathed Amabel Osling
in an awed voice.</p>

<p>"And you went straight home and wrote it out?" asked
Mildred Quain.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've got my office in the daytime. I can only write
at nights."</p>

<p>"Bit of a strain!" murmured Joe.</p>

<p>"It is rather. Besides, one doesn't begin by writing it out,
Miss Quain." He smiled in condescending pity. "One has to
construct, you see."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. How stupid of me!" said Mildred, rather
crestfallen.</p>

<p>"Not a bit, Miss Quain. You naturally didn't realise"&mdash;Mr.
Beverley seemed genuinely sorry if he had appeared to
snub her. "And I&mdash;I should like to tell you all how much I&mdash;I
feel what you're doing. Of course I believe in the thing
myself, but that's no reason why&mdash;Well, I tell you I do feel it.
I&mdash;I feel it really."</p>

<p>They had admired him before; they liked him the better
for this little speech. He came off his pedestal, and made
himself one of them&mdash;a co-adventurer. His hesitation and
his blush revealed him as human. They got a new and pleasantly
flattering sense of what they were doing. They were
not only going to make money and have fun; they were
helping genius.</p>

<p>Joe raised his glass. "Here's luck to the Author and the
Syndicate!"</p>

<p>"The what?" asked Amabel Osling. "I mean, what is a
syndicate?"</p>

<p>"We are!" answered Joe with mock solemnity. "Fill
your glasses&mdash;and no heel-taps!"</p>

<p>They drank to Mr. Claud Beverley and their enterprising
selves. Joe clasped the author's hand. Mr. Beverley drained
his glass.</p>

<p>"Here's luck!" he echoed. There was just a little shake
in his voice; the occasion was not without its emotions for
Mr. Beverley. Never before had he been the Hero of the
Evening. His imagination darted forward to a wider triumph.</p>

<p>Arthur was moved too. He felt a generous envy of Mr.
Beverley, awkward and melancholy as he was. Beverley was
doing something&mdash;really off his own bat. That was great.
Well, the next best thing was to help&mdash;to be in the venture;
even that was making something of life. As he listened to
the talk and shared in the excitement, his embarrassment
had worn away; and old Sarradet himself had clinked glasses
with him cordially.</p>

<p>Just on the heels of Mr. Beverley's "Here's luck!"&mdash;almost
clashing with it&mdash;came a loud ring at the front door.</p>

<p>"Why, who's that?" exclaimed Marie.</p>

<p>They heard the scurry of the maid's feet. Then came a
murmur of voices and the noise of the door closing. Then a
full hearty voice&mdash;known to them all except Mr. Beverley&mdash;said:
"That's better, old chap! You're all right now!"</p>

<p>The maid threw open the door of the room, and the festive
and excited group inside received a sudden shock that
banished all thought of Author and Syndicate alike. Very
pale, very dishevelled, and seeming to totter on his feet,
Raymond Sarradet came in, supported by Sidney Barslow's
sturdy arm round his shoulders. Sidney was dishevelled too;
his coat was torn all down the front, his hat was smashed. He
had a black eye, a cut on the lip, and a swollen nose. They
were a dismal battered pair.</p>

<p>"That's right, old chap! Here's a chair." Sidney gently
deposited his friend in a seat and looked round at the astonished
company. "They gave him a fair knock-out," he said,
"but he's come round now." Then he spoke to Marie directly.
"Still I thought I'd better see him home&mdash;he's a bit
shaky."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you too!" she exclaimed. And to the maid she
added: "Bring some hot water and a sponge quickly&mdash;and
towels, you know&mdash;Oh, and plaster! Be quick!"</p>

<p>"What the devil is all this?" demanded old Sarradet,
very red and very bristly.</p>

<p>"They'd have had everything out of me, but for Sidney.
Lucky if they hadn't killed me!" said Raymond, resting his
head on his hand. "Gad, how my head aches!"</p>

<p>Amabel came and laid her hand on his forehead. "Poor
boy! What can have happened?"</p>

<p>"Give them some champagne, Joe. Oh, Sidney, you are
hurt! Here's the hot water! Now let me!"</p>

<p>Sidney gave himself up to Marie's ministrations. Amabel
and Mildred bathed Raymond's head with Eau-de-Cologne.
Joe poured out champagne. The other men stood about,
looking as if they would like to do something, but could not
think of anything to do. In the course of the ministrations
the story gradually came out.</p>

<p>The two had gone to a suburban race-meeting together.
Fortune favoured Raymond, and he came away with considerably
more money than he started with. Three agreeable
strangers got into their carriage, coming home. Raymond
joined them in a game of cards, Sidney sitting out. On arrival
at Waterloo the agreeable strangers proposed a "bite"
together&mdash;and perhaps another little game afterwards?
Sidney tried to persuade Raymond to refuse the invitation,
but Raymond persisted in accepting it, and his friend would
not leave him. The story continued on familiar lines&mdash;so
familiar that Sidney's suspicions were very natural. There was
the "bite," the wine, the game&mdash;Sidney still not playing.
There was the lure of temporary success, the change of fortune,
the discovery of the swindling.</p>

<p>"Sidney was looking on, you know," said Raymond, "and
he nudged me. I had an idea myself by then, and I knew
what he meant. So I watched, and I saw him do it&mdash;the big
one with the red hair&mdash;you saw him too, didn't you, Sidney?
Well, I was excited and&mdash;and so on, and I just threw my cards
in his face. The next minute they rushed us up into a corner
and went for us like blazes, the three of them. I did my best,
but I'm only a lightweight. The big chap gave me one here"&mdash;he
touched the side of his chin&mdash;"and down I went. I could
call 'Murder!'&mdash;I wasn't unconscious&mdash;but that's all I could
do. And the three of them went for Sidney. By Jove, you
should have seen Sidney!"</p>

<p>"Rot!" came in a muffled tone from Sidney, whose lips
were being bathed and plastered.</p>

<p>"He kept them all going for the best part of five minutes,
I should think, and marked 'em too; gave 'em as good as
he got! And I shouted 'Murder!' all the time. And that's
what it would have been, if it had gone on much longer. But
the waiters came at last&mdash;we were in some kind of a restaurant
near Waterloo. I don't fancy the people were particular, but
I suppose they didn't want murder done there. And so they
came, and our friends made a bolt."</p>

<p>"But did nobody call the police?" asked Marie indignantly.</p>

<p>"Well," said Raymond, "they'd gone, you see, and&mdash;&mdash;"
He smiled weakly.</p>

<p>"It doesn't do any good to have that sort of thing in the
papers," Sidney remarked.</p>

<p>"There you're quite right," said old Sarradet with emphasis.
He came up to Sidney and laid his hand on his
shoulder. "Thank you, Barslow, for looking after that young
fool of mine," he added. "You showed great courage."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind a scrap, sir," said Sidney. "I like the
exercise."</p>

<p>"Oh, Sidney!" murmured Marie, in a very low voice, not
far from a sob. The other girls clapped their hands; the men
guffawed; Mr. Claud Beverley made a mental note&mdash;Not a
bad line that!</p>

<p>Amidst the clash of arms the laws are silent, and even the
arts do not go for much. Not Arthur's legal status nor yet his
new elegance, no, nor Mr. Claud Beverley's genius, had any
more chance that evening. The girls were aflame with primitive
woman's admiration of fighting man&mdash;of muscles, skill,
and pluck. Joe was an amateur of the noble art and must have
every detail of the encounter. Old Sarradet fussed about,
now scolding his son, now surreptitiously patting him on the
shoulder, always coming back to Sidney with fresh praises and
fresh proffers of champagne. Marie took her seat permanently
by the wounded warrior's side, and delicately conveyed the
foaming glass to his lacerated lips. More than admiration was
in her heart; she was a prey to severe remorse. She had sent
this man into banishment&mdash;a harsh sentence for a hasty word.
His response was to preserve her brother!</p>

<p>Marie would have been more or less than human if she had
not, by now, experienced a certain reaction of feeling in regard
to Arthur Lisle. Her resentment she kept for Mrs. Veltheim
and her father, and their bungling. Towards Arthur she
remained very friendly, even affectionately disposed. But a
sense of failure was upon her, and there came with it a diffidence
which made her, always now, doubtful of pleasing him.
Her old distrust of herself grew stronger; the fear of "grating"
on him was more insistent. Thus her pleasure in his
company was impaired, and she could no longer believe, as
she used, in his pleasure in being with her. She thought she
saw signs of uneasiness in him too sometimes&mdash;and she was
not always wrong about that. In the result, with all the
mutual goodwill in the world, there was a certain constraint.
Save in such moments of excitement as had arisen over Mr.
Beverley and his farce, neither could forget that there lay
between them one of those uncomfortable things of which
both parties are well aware, but which neither can mention.
It was a consciousness which tended not indeed to hostility,
but to separation. Arthur's new preoccupations, resulting
in his visits to Regent's Park being much less frequent, intensified
the feeling. Inevitably, as her dreams day by day faded,
some of the bright hues with which they had decked Arthur
Lisle faded from him also. He retained his own virtues and
attractions; but gradually again it became possible for there
to be other virtues and attractions in the world which were
not his and which might advance rival pretensions.</p>

<p>Her natural affinities with Sidney Barslow, checked and
indeed wilfully, if reluctantly, suppressed for the last few
weeks, would have revived in any event so soon as the
counter-attraction lost its monopolising power. The event of
this evening&mdash;the dramatic and triumphant return of the
banished friend&mdash;brought them to a quick and vigorous life
again. To forgive was not enough. She burned to welcome and
applaud&mdash;though still with a wary uneasy eye on Arthur. Yet
she was&mdash;perversely&mdash;glad that he was there, that he should
see what manner of man had suffered dismissal for his sake.
This desire to magnify in his eyes a sacrifice which had proved
useless was a subtle reproach to Arthur&mdash;the only one she
levelled against him.</p>

<p>He had been among the first to shake the warrior by the
hand. "Splendid, my dear fellow! Splendid!" he exclaimed
with a genuine enthusiasm. "I wish I'd been there
too&mdash;though I should have been of jolly little use, I'm
afraid." His humility was genuine too; at that moment he
would have given a great deal to be as good a fighting man as
Sidney Barslow.</p>

<p>Sidney gave his hand readily, but he looked apologetic
amidst all his glory. "Serves us right for taking up with
those chaps and going to the beastly place. But after the
races sometimes, you know&mdash;." He was trying to convey that
such associates and such resorts were not habitual with him.
He was remembering that unhappy encounter in Oxford
Street far more painfully than Arthur.</p>

<p>"Why, that was all Raymond's fault, anyhow," Marie
interposed indignantly. "You couldn't desert him!"</p>

<p>But Arthur did remember the encounter and with some
shame. If there were occasions on which a man might not
wish to know Sidney Barslow or to vouch for his respectability,
there were evidently others on which he would be glad
to have him by his side and to be recognised as entitled to his
friendly services. Very likely the latter were really the more
characteristic and important. At all events here he was
to-night, a gallant spirit, brave and gay in battle&mdash;no small
part of what goes to make a man. Arthur himself felt
rather small when he remembered his fastidious horror.</p>

<p>"We're all proud of you, Barslow," said old Sarradet in
his most impressive manner.</p>

<p>"We are, we are, we are!" cried Joe, and regardless of
poor Raymond's aching head, he sat down at the piano and
thumped out "See the Conquering Hero comes!"</p>

<p>Mr. Claud Beverley was robbed of the honours of the evening,
but, to do him justice, he took his deposition in good part.
In fact, as he walked home to those Northern Heights whence
had come his wonderful inspiration, he found and hailed yet
another Hero of the Evening. Neither Gifted Author nor
Splendid Warrior!</p>

<p>"Put in as much as that, did he! Just made it possible!
I should like to do that chap a turn if I could!"</p>

<p>Joe Halliday&mdash;his heart opened by emotion and champagne&mdash;had
told him the Secret of the Thousand.</p>

<h2>HOUSEHOLD POLITICS</h2>


<p>For the next three months&mdash;through the course of the
London season, a fine and prosperous one&mdash;Arthur
Lisle played truant. The poison of speculation was
in his veins, the lust of pleasure in his heart; romantic
imaginings and posings filled his thoughts. The Temple saw
little of him. More than once Norton Ward would have offered
him some "devilling" to do, or some case to make a note
on; but Henry reported that Mr. Lisle was not at chambers.
Norton Ward shrugged his shoulders and let the thing drop;
the first duty of an earnest aspirant in the Temple is to be
there&mdash;always waiting in the queue for employment. "You
can't help a man who won't help himself," Norton Ward
observed to his wife, who pursed up her lips and nodded
significantly; she knew what she knew about the young
man's case. Informed of his missed chances by a deferentially
reproachful Henry, Arthur was impenitent. He did not
want to make notes on cases and to do devilling; not so much
now because of his terrors (though he still felt that Pretyman,
<span class="smcap">j</span>., was formidable) as because his own interests were too
enthralling; he had no time to spare for the quarrels of John
Doe and Richard Roe and the rest of the litigious tribe.
There were roads to fortune shorter, less arid and less steep.
Also there were green pastures and flowery dells, very pleasant
though they led nowhere in particular, peopled by charming
companions, enlivened by every diversion&mdash;and governed by
a Fairy Queen.</p>

<p>In London an agreeable young man who has&mdash;or behaves
as if he had&mdash;nothing to do will soon find things to do in
plenty. Arthur's days were full; lunches, dinners, theatres,
dances, tennis to play, cricket and polo matches to watch, a
race-meeting now and then, motor excursions or a day on
the river&mdash;time went like lightning in amusing himself and
other people. Everybody accepted so readily the view that
he was a man of leisure and wholly at their disposal that he
himself almost came to accept it as the truth. Only in the
background lay the obstinate fact that, in a life like this,
even five hundred pounds will not last for ever. Never mind!
In the autumn there would come the farce. There was a rare
flavour in the moment when he wrote his cheque for a thousand
pounds, payable to the order of Joseph Halliday, Esquire.
Joe had asked for an instalment only, but Arthur was not
going to fritter away the sensation like that.</p>

<p>Of course Bernadette had first call on him, and she used
her privilege freely. At her house in Hill Street he was really
at home; he was expected to come without an invitation;
he was expected to come in spite of any other invitation,
when he was wanted. He fetched and carried, an abject
delighted slave. She never flirted with him or tried to win
his devotion; but she accepted it and in return made a pet
of him. Yet she had no idea how immense, how romantic,
how high-flying the devotion was. She was not very good at
understanding great emotions&mdash;as Oliver Wyse might perhaps
have agreed. So, if she had no designs, she had no caution
either; she was as free from conscience as from malice; or
it might be that any conscience she had was engaged upon
another matter. Sir Oliver had not yet returned to town,
but soon he was coming.</p>

<p>Engrossed in Bernadette herself, at first Arthur paid little
heed to the other members of the household. Indeed he never
became intimate with Judith Arden during all this time in
London. He liked her, and forgave a satirical look which he
sometimes caught directed at himself in consideration of her
amusing satirical remarks directed at other people; and after
all she could not be expected to appreciate the quality of his
devotion to Bernadette. But with Godfrey Lisle things gradually
reached a different footing. The shy awkward man
began to put out feelers for friendship. Amongst all who
came and went he had few friends, and he sought to make
no more. Even Judith, as became her age and sex, was
much occupied in gaieties. He spent his days in his library
and in walking. But now he began to ask Arthur to join
him. "If Bernadette can spare you," he would say; or, to
his wife, "If you don't want Arthur this afternoon&mdash;" and
so suggest a walk or a smoke together. He did not succeed
in conveying the impression that he would be greatly pleased
by the acceptance of his invitations. But he did give them,
and that from him was much.</p>

<p>"Do go," Bernadette would say, or "Do stay," as the case
might be. "He does like a talk so much." Strangely it
appeared that this was the case, provided he could get his
talk quietly with a single person&mdash;and, it must be added,
though Arthur's eyes were not yet opened to this, provided that
the person was not his wife. From private conversation with
her he shrank, ever fearing that something might seem to be
demanded of him which he could not give. But he read and
thought much, and enjoyed an exchange of ideas. And he
took to Arthur with the liking a reserved man often has for
one who is expansive and easy of access. Arthur responded
to his overtures, at first through a mixture of obligation and
good-nature, then with a real interest, to which presently
there was added a sympathy rather compassionate, a pity
for a man who seemed by nature unable to take the pleasures
which lay so plentiful around.</p>

<p>He fretted about money too&mdash;a thing pathetic to the eyes
with which at present Arthur looked on the world. But he
did; he might be found surrounded by account-books, rent-books,
pass-books, puzzling over them with a forlorn air and
a wrinkled brow. It was not long before he took Arthur into
his confidence, in some degree at least, about this worry of
his.</p>

<p>"We spend a terrible lot of money; I can't think where it
all goes," he lamented.</p>

<p>"But isn't it pretty obvious?" laughed Arthur. "You
do things in style&mdash;and you're always doing them!"</p>

<p>"There's this house&mdash;heavy! And Hilsey always sitting
there, swallowing a lot!" Then he broke out in sudden
peevishness: "Of course with anything like common prudence&mdash;&mdash;"
He stopped abruptly. "I'm not blaming anybody,"
he added lamely, after a pause. And then&mdash;"Do you
keep within your income?"</p>

<p>"I don't just now&mdash;by a long chalk. But yours is a trifle
larger than mine, you know."</p>

<p>"I can't do it. Well, I must raise some money, I suppose."</p>

<p>Arthur did not know what to say. The matter was intimate
and delicate; for there could be no doubt who was responsible,
if too much money were being spent.</p>

<p>"I'm sure if you&mdash;well, if you made it known how you
feel&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Yes, and be thought a miser!" His voice sank to a
mutter just audible. "Besides all the rest!"</p>

<p>So he had grievances! Arthur smiled within himself. All
husbands, he opined, had grievances, mostly unsubstantial
ones. He could not believe that Godfrey was being forced
into outrunning his means to any serious extent, or that he
had any other grave cause for complaint. But, in truth,
Godfrey's trouble&mdash;money apart&mdash;was an awkward one. He
was aggrieved that he had not got what he did not want&mdash;his
wife's affection. And he was aggrieved that she did not
want what he had no desire to give her&mdash;namely, his. The
state of things aggrieved him, yet he had no wish&mdash;at least
no effective impulse&mdash;to alter it. He felt himself a failure in
all ways save one&mdash;the provision of the fine things and the
pleasures that Bernadette loved. Was he now to be a failure
there too? He clung to the last rag of his tattered pride.</p>

<p>Yet often he was, in his shy awkward way, kindly, gracious,
and anxious to make his kinsman feel sure of a constant
welcome.</p>

<p>"Coming too often?" he said, in reply to a laughing
apology of Arthur's. "You can't come too often, my dear
boy! Besides you're a cousin of the house; it's open to you
of right, both here and at Hilsey. Bernadette likes you to
come too."</p>

<p>"Has she told you so?" Arthur asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, no, not in words, but anybody can see she does.
We're too grave for her&mdash;Judith and I&mdash;and so's Oliver Wyse,
I think. She likes him, of course, but with him she can't&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Play about?" Arthur suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, exactly&mdash;can't do that sort of thing, as she
does with you. He's got too much on his shoulders; and he's
an older man, of course." He was walking up and down his
library as he talked. He stopped in passing and laid his
hand on Arthur's shoulder for a moment. "It's good of
you not to grudge me a talk either, sometimes."</p>

<p>"But I like talking to you. Why do you think I shouldn't?"</p>

<p>Godfrey was at the other end of the room by now, with
his back turned, looking into a book.</p>

<p>"You've never seen Hilsey, have you? Would it bore
you to come down for a bit later on? Very quiet there, of
course, but not so bad. Not for longer than you like, of
course! You could cut it short if you got bored, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be afraid of my being bored. I should
love it of all things." Indeed the invitation filled him with
delight and gratitude. "It's jolly good of you, Godfrey, jolly
kind, I think."</p>

<p>Godfrey murmured something like, "See how you like it
when you get there," sat down with his back still turned, and
obliterated himself with a large book.</p>

<p>He was certainly difficult to know, to get to close quarters
with. If he approached you at one moment, he shrank back
the next; he seemed to live in equal fear of advances and of
rebuffs. It was difficult to know how to take him, what idea
to form of him. Plenty of negations suggested themselves
readily in connection with him, but positive qualities were
much harder to assign; it was easier to say what he was
not than what he was, what he did not like than what he did,
what he could not do than what he could. At all events what
positive qualities he had did not help him much in his life,
and were irrelevant to the problems it presented. By nature
he was best made for a student, immured in books, free from
the cares of position and property, and from the necessity
of understanding and working with other people. Fate had
misplaced him as a wealthy man, burdened with obligations,
cumbered with responsibilities. He had misplaced himself
as the husband of a brilliant and pleasure-loving wife. He
ought to have been a bachelor&mdash;the liabilities of bachelors
are limited&mdash;or the mate of an unpretending housewife who
would have seen to his dinner and sewn on his buttons. In
an unlucky hour of impulse he had elected to play Prince
Charming to a penniless Beauty; Prince Charming appearing
in a shower of gold. Of all the charms only the gold was left
now, and the supply even of that was not inexhaustible,
though the Beauty might behave as if it were. He had
failed to live up to the promise of his first appearance, to
meet the bill of exchange which he had accepted when he
married Bernadette. He lacked the qualifications; ardour
of emotion, power to understand and value a nature different
from his own, an intelligent charity that could recognise the
need in another for things of which he felt no need&mdash;these
he had not, any more than he possessed the force of will
and character which might have moulded the other nature to
his own.</p>

<p>He met his failure with a certain dignity of bearing which
all his awkwardness could not efface. He did not carp at
his wife or quarrel with her; he treated her with consistent
politeness and with a liberality even excessive. He showed
no jealousy of her preferences; that she would ever give him
cause for serious jealousy, fears for his honour, had never yet
entered his head; such matters did not lie within the ordinary
ambit of his thoughts. But the sense of failure had bitten
deep into his heart; his pride chafed under it perpetually.
His life was soured.</p>

<p>Arthur saw little of all this, and of what he did see he
made light. It is always the easiest and most comfortable
thing to assume that people are doing as they like and liking
what they are doing. If Godfrey lived apart from the life
of the house, doubtless it was by his own choice; and, if he
had a grievance, it must just be about money. The paymaster
always has a grievance about money; he is Ishmael, with
every man's and every woman's hand against him&mdash;stretched
out for more. A legitimate occasion for a grumble&mdash;but it
would be absurd to make much of it.</p>

<p>Besides what serious trouble could there be when Bernadette
was so radiant and serene, so gay and merry with himself
and with Judith, so gentle and friendly with her husband?
There seemed no question of two parties in the house&mdash;as there
sometimes are in houses&mdash;with the one or the other of which
it was necessary for him to range himself. His adoration for
Bernadette in no way clashed with his growing affection for
her husband; rather she encouraged and applauded every
sign of greater intimacy between the men. It was with the
sense of a triumph in which she would surely share that he
carried to her the news that Godfrey&mdash;Godfrey himself, of
his own accord&mdash;had invited him to Hilsey. Of her cordial
endorsement of the invitation he had, of course, no doubt.
Perhaps, after all, she had inspired it.</p>

<p>"Now don't say you put him up to it! That wouldn't be
half such a score," he said, laughing.</p>

<p>She seemed surprised at the news; evidently she had not
taken any part in the matter. She looked a little thoughtful,
possibly even doubtful. Judith Arden, who was sitting by,
smiled faintly.</p>

<p>"No, I had nothing to do with it," said Bernadette. "And
it really is a triumph for you, Arthur." She was smiling
again now, but there was a little pucker on her brow. "When's
your best time to come?" she asked.</p>

<p>"In the early part of August, if I may. I shall have to
run up and see mother afterwards, and I've got to be back in
town in the middle of September&mdash;for our production, you
know."</p>

<p>Bernadette by this time had been told all about the great
farce and the great venture which had made it possible.</p>

<p>She appeared to consider something for a moment longer,
so that Arthur added, "Of course if it's not convenient to
have me then, if you're full up or anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goodness no! There are twenty rooms, and there'll be
nobody but ourselves&mdash;and Oliver Wyse perhaps."</p>

<p>"I thought Sir Oliver was coming earlier, directly we go
down?" said Judith.</p>

<p>"He's coming about the seventeenth or eighteenth; but
he may stay on, of course. On the other hand he may not
come, or may come later, after all." She smiled again, this
time as it were to herself. Sir Oliver's visit to Hilsey had been
arranged before she lunched with him in Paris and might,
therefore, be subject to reconsideration&mdash;by the guest, or the
hostess, or both. She had neither seen him nor heard from him
since that occasion; things stood between them just where
they had been left when she turned away and went into the
hat-shop with glowing cheeks. There they remained even
to her own mind, in a state of suspense not unpleasurable but
capable of becoming difficult. It was just that possibility in
them which made her brow pucker at the thought of Sir
Oliver and Arthur Lisle encountering one another as fellow-guests
at Hilsey.</p>

<p>Arthur laughed. "Well, if he doesn't mind me, I don't
mind him. In fact I like him very much&mdash;what I've seen of
him; it isn't much."</p>

<p>It was not much. Before Oliver Wyse went to Paris, they
had met at Hill Street only three or four times, and then at
large dinner parties where they had been thrown very little
in contact.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course you'll get on all right together," said
Bernadette.</p>

<p>"You've a lot in common with him really, I believe,"
Judith remarked.</p>

<p>Bernadette's lips twisted in a smile and she gave Judith a
glance of merry reproof. They were both amused to see how
entirely the point of the observation was lost on Arthur.</p>

<p>"I daresay we shall find we have, when we come to know
each other better," he agreed in innocent sincerity.</p>

<p>Bernadette was stirred to one of the impulses of affectionate
tenderness which the absolute honesty and simplicity
of his devotion now and then roused in her. His faith in her
was as absolute as his adoration was unbounded. For him
she was as far above frailty as she was beyond rivalry or
competition. Without realising the immensity of either the
faith or the adoration, she yet felt that, if temptation should
come, it might help her to have somebody by her who believed
in her thoroughly and as it were set her a standard to live up
to. And she was unwillingly conscious that a great temptation
might come&mdash;or perhaps it was better to say that she
might be subjected to a severe pressure; for it was in this
light rather that the danger presented itself to her mind
when she was driven to think about it.</p>

<p>She looked at him now with no shadow on her face, with
all her usual radiant friendliness.</p>

<p>"At any rate I shall be delighted to have you there, Cousin
Arthur," she said. She had managed, somehow, from the
first to make the formal "Cousin" into just the opposite of
a formality&mdash;to turn it into a term of affection and appropriation.
She used it now not habitually, but when she wanted
to tell him that she was liking him very much, and he quite
understood that it had that significance. He flushed in
pleasure and gratitude.</p>

<p>"That's enough for me. Never mind Sir Oliver!" he
exclaimed with a joyful laugh.</p>

<p>"If it isn't an anti-climax, may I observe that I too shall
be very glad to see you?" said Judith Arden with affected
primness.</p>

<p>Arthur went away in triumph, surer still of Bernadette's
perfection, making lighter still of Godfrey's grievances, dismissing
Oliver Wyse as totally unimportant; blind to all the
somewhat complicated politics of the house. They rolled
off his joyous spirit like water off a duck's back.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h2>LUNCH AT THE LANCASTER</h2>


<p>On a day in July, when this wonderful London season
was drawing near an end, and the five hundred
pounds had reached about half-way towards exhaustion,
Arthur Lisle gave himself and his friends a treat.
He invited the Syndicate&mdash;as they laughingly styled themselves&mdash;to
lunch at the Lancaster Hotel. There were some
disappointing refusals. Mr. Sarradet would not come; he
was sulky in these days, for Raymond was neglecting his
father's perfumery and spending his father's money; the
integrity of the dowry was threatened, and old Sarradet had
a very cold fit about the prospects of the theatrical speculation.
Sidney Barslow&mdash;he was invited thanks to his heroic
re-entry&mdash;pleaded work. The author himself wrote that he
would be unavoidably detained at "the office"&mdash;Mr. Beverley
was never more definite than that about the occupation which
filled the day-time for him. But Marie and Amabel came,
escorted by Joe Halliday, and they made a merry party of
four. The girls were excited at being asked to the Lancaster.
Such sumptuous places, though not perhaps beyond the
Sarradet means, were quite foreign to the thrifty Sarradet
habits. Amabel was of the suburbs and patronised "popular
price" restaurants on her visits to town. Joe lived in grill
rooms. The balcony of the Lancaster seemed magnificent,
and Emile, the <i>maÃ®tre d'hÃ´tel</i>, knew Arthur quite well, called
him by his name, and told him what brand of champagne he
liked&mdash;marks of intimacy which could not fail to make an
impression on Arthur's guests, and which Emile had a tactful
way of bestowing even on quite occasional patrons.</p>

<p>Joe Halliday made his report. Everything was in trim,
and going on swimmingly. The theatre was taken, a producer
engaged, the girl who was Joe's own discovery secured
and, besides her, a famous comic actor who could carry anything&mdash;anything&mdash;on
his back. Rehearsals were to begin in
a month.</p>

<p>"By this time next year lunch at the Lancaster will be an
every-day event. Just now it can't be&mdash;so I'll trouble you
for a little more fizz, Arthur," said Joe, with his great jolly
laugh.</p>

<p>"Don't count your chickens&mdash;&mdash;!" said cautious Marie.</p>

<p>"A coward's proverb!" cried Arthur gaily. "Why, you
lose half the fun if you don't!"</p>

<p>"Even if we do fail, we shall have had our fun," Joe
remarked philosophically.</p>

<p>The others could hardly follow him to these serene heights.
Amabel had persuaded gold out of her "governor." Marie
felt decidedly responsible to old Sarradet; and the pledge that
Arthur had given to fortune was very heavy.</p>

<p>"If it becomes necessary, we'll try to feel like that," said
Arthur, "but I hope we shan't have to try."</p>

<p>"Of course we shan't," Amabel insisted eagerly. "How
can it fail? Of course it mayn't be quite such an enormous
success as <i>Help Me</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It'll knock <i>Help Me Out Quickly</i> into a cocked hat,"
Joe pronounced decisively. "Just see if it don't!" He
turned to Marie. "Then what sort of a smile shall we
see on old Sidney's face?" He could not quite forgive
Sidney Barslow (hero as he was!) for having refused to
"come in."</p>

<p>"Sidney's a wise man about business and&mdash;and money.
Wiser than we are perhaps!" Marie smiled as she ate her
ice.</p>

<p>"Sidney's developing all the virtues at a great pace,"
laughed Amabel. "Under somebody's influence!"</p>

<p>Joe laughed too; so did Marie, but she also blushed a
little. Arthur was suddenly conscious of a joke which was
new to him&mdash;something which the other three understood
but he did not. He looked at Joe in involuntary questioning.
Joe winked. He saw Marie's blush; it caused him a vague
displeasure.</p>

<p>"Yes," Joe nodded. "He is. Works like a horse and goes
to bed at eleven o'clock! I shouldn't be surprised if he turned
up one fine day with a blue ribbon in his coat!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be so silly, Joe," laughed Marie; but the
laugh sounded a little vexed, and the blush was not quite
gone yet.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"Joking apart, he has put the brake on. Jolly good thing
too! He's such a good chap&mdash;really."</p>

<p>Arthur was not ungenerous, but he could not help feeling
that the apotheosis of Sidney Barslow might be carried too
far. The vision of the scene in Oxford Street was still vivid
in his mind; it would need a lot of heroism, a lot of reformation,
altogether to obliterate that, however much he might
agree to a gentler judgment of it.</p>

<p>"No, don't make a joke of it, Joe, anyhow not to Sidney
himself," said Marie, looking a little embarrassed still, but
speaking with her usual courage. "Because it's for our sake&mdash;well,
mostly so, I think&mdash;that he's&mdash;he's doing what he is.
I told him that in the beginning he had led Raymond into
mischief, and that he ought to set him a better example now.
And he's trying&mdash;without much success, I'm afraid, as far as
Raymond is concerned." Her voice grew very troubled.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry, Marie," Arthur murmured.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no intention of rotting Sidney about it. If only
because he'd probably hit me in the eye!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we know his fighting powers," laughed Amabel in
admiring reminiscence. Her tone changed to one of regretful
exasperation. "Raymond is a goose!"</p>

<p>"But we mustn't spoil Mr. Lisle's party with our troubles,"
said Marie, smiling again.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, I say, I'm not altogether an outsider!" Arthur
protested with a sudden touch of vehemence.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not that," Marie murmured, with a little shake
of her head; her tone did not sound very convinced. Amabel
giggled feebly. Joe covered a seeming embarrassment by
gulping down his coffee and pretending to find it too hot. A
constraint fell upon the party. Arthur wanted to make
himself thoroughly one with them in anxiety and concern
over Raymond's misdeeds&mdash;nay, even in admiration for Sidney
Barslow's reformation; he wanted to, if he could. Yet
somehow he found no words in which to convey his desire.
Every phrase that came into his head he rejected; they all
sounded cold and unreal, somehow aloof and even patronising.
Silence, however awkward, was better than speeches like
that.</p>

<p>It was one of Joe Halliday's chosen missions in life, and one
of his greatest gifts, to relieve occasions of restraint and
embarrassment by a dexterous use of humour. This social
operation he now, perceiving it necessary, proceeded to perform.
Clapping his hand to his forehead in a melodramatic
manner, he exclaimed in low but intense tones, "Ask me who
I want to be! Who I want to be in all the world! Ask me
quickly!"</p>

<p>He won his smiles. "What's the matter now, Joe?"
asked Arthur; his smile was tolerant.</p>

<p>"No, I'll tell you! Don't speak!" He pointed with his
finger, past Arthur, towards the other end of the room. "There
he sits! A murrain on him! That's the man! And how
dare he lunch with that Entrancing Creature?"</p>

<p>"Which one, Joe? Which one?" asked Amabel, immediately
full of interest.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;behind Arthur's back. He can't see her. Good
thing too! He doesn't deserve to."</p>

<p>"I suppose I can turn round, if I want to&mdash;and if she's
worth it. Is she, Marie?"</p>

<p>"Is it the one in blue, Joe? Yes, she is. Awfully pretty!"</p>

<p>"Never saw such a corker in my life!" Joe averred with
solemnity.</p>

<p>"Then round&mdash;in a careless manner&mdash;goes my head!"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>"He woos her, I swear he woos her, curses on his mother's
grave!" Joe rode his jokes rather hard.</p>

<p>"We'd better not all stare at her, had we?" asked Marie.</p>

<p>"She's not looking; she's listening to the man," Amabel
assured her.</p>

<p>Arthur turned round again&mdash;after a long look. He gave a
little laugh. "It's my cousin, Bernadette Lisle. Joe, you
are an ass."</p>

<p>It was Bernadette Lisle; she sat at a little table with
Oliver Wyse. They had finished eating. Bernadette was
putting on her gloves. Her eyes were fixed on Oliver's face,
her lips were parted. The scene of the CafÃ© de Paris reproduced
itself&mdash;and perhaps the topic. She had not seen Arthur
when he came in, nor he her. She did not see him now. She
listened to Sir Oliver.</p>

<p>"Your cousin! That! Introduce me&mdash;there may yet be
time!" said the indomitable Joe.</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" groaned Arthur, half-flattered however,
though half-peevish.</p>

<p>"She's very beautiful." Marie's eyes could not leave
Bernadette. "And so&mdash;so&mdash;well, she looks like something
very very precious in china."</p>

<p>Arthur looked round again; he could not help it. "Yes,
that is rather it, Marie."</p>

<p>"Look&mdash;look at her hat, Marie!" came from Amabel in
awed accents. Indeed the visit to the hat-shop in Paris had
not been without its fruit.</p>

<p>"Now is it fair&mdash;is it reasonable&mdash;for a fellow to have a
cousin like that? He might have a Queen like that, or a
Dream like that, and I shouldn't care. But a cousin! He
knows the Vision! He's talked to it! Heavens, he's probably
lunched with it himself! And he kept it all dark from us&mdash;oh,
so dark!"</p>

<p>"Is it Mr. Lisle with her?" asked Amabel, quite innocently.</p>

<p>Arthur smiled. "No, I don't think you'd find Godfrey
lunching here. That's a man named Wyse. I've met him
at their house."</p>

<p>"He's good-looking too," Amabel decided after a further
survey.</p>

<p>A waiter brought Oliver Wyse his bill. When he turned
to pay it, Bernadette rose. The spell which had held her
attention so closely was broken. She looked round the room.
Suddenly a bright smile came on her lips, she spoke a hurried
word to her companion, and came straight across the room
towards Arthur's table. She had recognised the back of his
head.</p>

<p>"She's coming here!" whispered Amabel breathlessly.</p>

<p>Arthur turned round quickly, a bright gleam in his eyes.
He rose from his chair; the next moment she was beside
him, looking so joyful, so altogether happy.</p>

<p>"Oh, Arthur dear, I am glad!" She did not offer to
shake hands; she laid her little hand on his coat-sleeve as
she greeted him. "Did you see me&mdash;with Sir Oliver?" But
she did not wait for an answer. "Do let me sit down with
you for a minute. And mayn't I know your friends?" A
waiter hurried up with a chair, and Bernadette sat down by
Arthur. "Why, what fun this is! Cousin Arthur, I must
have another ice." The gloves began to come off again, while
Arthur made the necessary introductions.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I know you all quite well!" exclaimed Bernadette.
"You're old friends of mine, though you may not know it."</p>

<p>Oliver Wyse, his bill paid, followed her with a leisurely
step. He greeted Arthur cordially and included the rest of
the table in a bow. "I gather you intend to stay a bit," he
said to Bernadette, smiling. "I've got an appointment, so
if you'll excuse me&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Arthur will look after me." She gave him her
hand. "Thanks for your lunch, Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"It was so good of you to come," he answered, with
exactly the right amount of courteous gratitude.</p>

<p>As he went off, she watched him for just a moment, then
turned joyously back to her new companions. A casual observer
might well have concluded that she was glad to be
rid of Oliver Wyse.</p>

<p>Joe was&mdash;to use his own subsequent expression&mdash;"corpsed";
he had not a joke to make! Perhaps that was as well. But
he devoured her with his eyes, manifesting an open admiration
whose simple sincerity robbed it of offence. Bernadette
saw it, and laughed at it without disguise. Amabel's eyes
were even more for frock and hat than for the wearer; this
it was to be not merely clothed but dressed. Marie had paid
her homage to beauty; she was watching and wondering now.
Arthur tasted a new delight in showing off his wonderful
cousin to his old friends, a new pride in the gracious kindness
of her bearing towards them. And Bernadette herself was as
charming as she could be for Arthur's sake, and in gratitude
for his appearance&mdash;for the casual observer would have been
quite right as to her present feeling about Oliver Wyse.</p>

<p>Marie Sarradet revised her notions. She forgave her father
his meddling; even against Mrs. Veltheim she pressed the
indictment less harshly. Here surely was the paramount
cause of her defeat! Mrs. Lisle and what Mrs. Lisle stood for
against herself and what she represented&mdash;candid-minded
Marie could not for a moment doubt the issue. Her little,
firmly repressed grievance against Arthur faded away; she
must have a grievance against fate, if against anything.
For it was fate or chance which had brought Mrs. Lisle on to
the scene just when the issue hung in the balance. Yet with
her quick woman's intuition, quickened again by her jealous
interest, she saw clearly in ten minutes, in a quarter of an
hour&mdash;while Bernadette chattered about the farce (valuable
anyhow as a topic in common!) and wistfully breathed
the hope that she would be able to come up from the
country for the first night&mdash;that the brilliant beautiful
cousin had for Arthur Lisle no more than a simple
honest affection, flavoured pleasantly by his adoration,
piquantly by amusement at him. He was her friend and her
plaything, her protÃ©gÃ© and her pet. There was not even a
fancy for him, sentimental or romantic; at the idea of a
passion she would laugh. See how easy and unconstrained she
was, how open in her little familiar gestures of affection!
This woman had nothing here to conceal, nothing to struggle
against. It was well, no doubt. But it made Marie Sarradet
angry, both for herself and for Arthur's sake. To take so
lightly what had so nearly been another's&mdash;to think so lightly
of all that she had taken!</p>

<p>The intuition, quick as it was, had its limits; maybe it
worked better on women than on men, or perhaps Marie's
mind was somewhat matter-of-fact and apt to abide within
obvious alternatives&mdash;such as "He's in love, or he's not&mdash;and
there's an end of it!" Arthur loved his cousin's wife,
without doubt. But, so far at least, it was an adoration,
not a passion; an ardour, not a pursuit. He asked no more
than he received&mdash;leave to see her, to be with her, to enjoy
her presence, and in so doing to be welcome and pleasant to
her. Above all&mdash;as a dim and distant aspiration, to which
circumstances hitherto had shown no favour&mdash;to serve her,
help her, be her champion. This exalted sentiment, these
rarefied emotions, escaped the analysis of Marie's intuition.
What she saw was an Arthur who squandered all the jewels
of his heart and got nothing for them; whereas in truth up
to now he was content; he was paid his price and counted
himself beyond measure a gainer by the bargain.</p>

<p>Who was the other man&mdash;the man of quiet demeanour and
resolute face, who had so held her attention, who had so
tactfully resigned the pleasure of her company? Marie's
mind, quick again to the obvious, fastened on this question.</p>

<p>Bernadette, under friendly pressure, rose from a hope to
an intention. "I will come to the first night," she declared.
"I will if I possibly can."</p>

<p>"Now is that a promise, Mrs. Lisle?" asked Joe eagerly.
After all, the farce was his discovery, in a special sense his
property. He had the best right to a paternal pride in it.</p>

<p>"It's a promise, with a condition," said Arthur, laughing.
"She will&mdash;if she can. Now I don't think promises like that
are worth much. Do you, Marie?"</p>

<p>"It's the most prudent sort of promise to give."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it never contents a man," Bernadette complained.
"Men are so exacting and so&mdash;so tempestuous."
She broke into a little laugh, rather fretful.</p>

<p>"Now am I tempestuous?" Arthur asked, with a protesting
gesture of his hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not all the world, Arthur," she told him, just
a little scornfully, but with a consoling pat on the arm. "You
know what I mean, Miss Sarradet? They want things so
definite&mdash;all in black and white! And if they can't have
them like that, they tell you you're a shillyshallying sort
of person without a mind and, as I say, get tempestuous
about it."</p>

<p>Joe had regained some of his self-confidence. "If anybody
bothers you like that, just you send him to me, Mrs. Lisle.
I'll settle him!" His manner conveyed a jocose ferocity.</p>

<p>"I wish you would! I mean, I wonder if you could. They
talk as if one's mind only existed to be made up&mdash;like a
prescription. One's mind isn't a medicine! It's a&mdash;a&mdash;What
is it, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"It's a faculty given us for the agreeable contemplation
and appreciation of the world."</p>

<p>"Quite right!" declared Bernadette in emphatic approval.
"That's exactly what I think."</p>

<p>"It would clearly promote your agreeable appreciation
of the world to come to our first night, Mrs. Lisle," urged
Joe.</p>

<p>"Of course it would&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you'll come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come&mdash;if I possibly can," said Bernadette.</p>

<p>They all began to laugh. Bernadette joined in. "Back to
where we began&mdash;just like a woman!" exclaimed Arthur.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that's just what I mean, Miss Sarradet. He's
begun to bully!"</p>

<p>"Well, I must. Because why shouldn't you be able to
come, you see?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, pursing up her smiling lips. "Circumstances,
Cousin Arthur!" And she pushed back her chair
from the table.</p>

<p>"Oh, rot! And, I say, don't go, Bernadette!"</p>

<p>"I must. I'm awfully sorry to. You're all so nice."</p>

<p>"And if you possibly can, Mrs. Lisle? D.V.? That kind
of thing, you know?"</p>

<p>"Unless circumstances absolutely prevent!" she playfully
promised for the last time, as she turned away, Arthur following
to put her in her carriage.</p>

<p>Joe Halliday drew a long breath. "Well now, girls, how's
that for high?"</p>

<p>"Why, her hat alone must have&mdash;&mdash;" Amabel began,
with every appearance of meaning to expatiate.</p>

<p>"I wonder what she's really like!" said Marie thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"She's really like an angel&mdash;down to the last feather!"
Joe declared with an emphasis which overbore contradiction.</p>

<h2>SETTLED</h2>


<p><i>Le chÃ¢teau qui parle et la femme qui Ã©coute</i>&mdash;Bernadette
Lisle had begun to be conscious of the truth contained
in the proverb, and to recognise where she had made
her great mistake. Though Oliver Wyse had told her that he
was in love with her, she had allowed him to go on coming to
the house as usual; and she had not even explicitly barred
the dangerous topic. Little use if she had! To keep him on
the other side of the hall-door was really the only way. But,
though startled and frightened, she had not been affronted;
though rejecting his suit, she had been curious and excited
about it. It was a complication indeed; but it cut across a
home-life which had not complications of that kind enough,
in which nobody catered for her emotions; she had to look
somewhere outside for that. A lover makes a woman very interesting
to herself. He casts a new light on familiar things;
he turns disagreeables into tragedies, routine into slavery,
placid affection into neglect. He converts whims into aspirations,
freaks into instincts, selfishness into the realisation of
self. All this with no willing hypocrisy, not at all meaning to
tell her lies. He is simply making her see herself as he sees her,
to behold with him her transfiguration.</p>

<p>Oliver Wyse was lucky in that he had more truth on his side
than many a lover can boast. Her life was starved of great
things; she was in a sense wasted; her youth and beauty,
things that pass, were passing with no worthy scope; where
the sweetest intimacy should be, there was none; her marriage
was a misfit. It could not be denied that she had contrived,
in spite of these unpromising facts, to be fairly happy. But
that was before her eyes were open, he hinted, before she had
looked on the transfiguration, before she knew her true self.
She supposed that must be so, though with an obstinate
feeling that she might manage to be fairly happy again, if
only he and his transfiguration would go away&mdash;or if she might
just look at it, and wonder, and admire, without being committed
to the drastic steps which lovers expect of the transfigurations
they have made. Is it absolutely necessary to
throw your cap over the mill just because somebody at last
really understands and appreciates you? That was a question
Bernadette often asked herself&mdash;quite fretfully. The
action was threatened by so many penalties, spiritual and
worldly.</p>

<p>She had her shrewdness also, increased by the experience
of a beauty, who has seen many aspire in golden ardour, sigh
in piteous failure, and presently ride away on another chase
with remarkably cheerful countenances. If this after failure,
what after success? Men were tempestuous in wooing; what
were they when the fight was won? She knew about her
husband, of course, but she meant real men&mdash;so her thoughts
perilously put a contrast.</p>

<p>"Have you often been in love, Sir Christopher?" she asked
the old Judge one day as he sat in her little den, sipping
tea and smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p>He was a lifelong bachelor. "Often, Bernadette."</p>

<p>"Now, tell me," she said, leaning towards him with a
knitted brow and a mighty serious look. "Of all the women
you've been in love with, is there anyone you now wish you'd
married?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. Two."</p>

<p>"Out of how many?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. A matter of double figures, I'm afraid."
Smiling, he put an apologetic note into his voice. "They're
not the two I was most desperate about, Bernadette."</p>

<p>"Of course I should very much like to know who they were."</p>

<p>"But since, of course, that's impossible, let us continue
the discussion in the abstract."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you marry them&mdash;well, one of them, I mean,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Is that the abstract? Well, one of them refused."</p>

<p>"To marry you?"</p>

<p>"She refused, Bernadette. Now please go back to the abstract."</p>

<p>"Without asking about the other?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so."</p>

<p>"All right. I don't think I care so much about desperation
myself, you know."</p>

<p>"Seen too much of it probably!" His old blue eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p>"I could have fallen awfully in love with you, Judge. Do
you often think about those two?"</p>

<p>"Oftener about the others."</p>

<p>"That's very perverse of you."</p>

<p>"The whole thing's infernally perverse," said the Judge.</p>

<p>"However I suppose you've pretty well forgotten about
the whole thing now?"</p>

<p>"The deuce you do!"</p>

<p>"Did you soon get to be glad you hadn't married them&mdash;the
other twenty or so?"</p>

<p>"That varied. Besides, if I had married them, I might
have become quite content."</p>

<p>"They'd have got to look older, of course," Bernadette
reflected. "But people ought to be content with&mdash;well, with
being content, oughtn't they?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, you're generally young when you're in love&mdash;comparatively,
at all events. You get content with being
content&mdash;as you neatly put it&mdash;rather later."</p>

<p>"That means you're not in love any more?"</p>

<p>"Life has its stages, Bernadette."</p>

<p>She gave a quick little shiver. "Horrid!"</p>

<p>"And children come, bringing all sorts of ties. That must
make a difference." The old man sighed lightly, clasping
together his thin hands with their gleaming rings.</p>

<p>"Oh, a tremendous difference, of course," Bernadette made
orthodox reply.</p>

<p>In effect just what she had said to Oliver Wyse himself
when she lunched with him at the Lancaster! "Among other
things, you forget Margaret," she had said, reinforcing her
resistance with every plea which came to her hand. "I don't
forget her, but I think first of all of you," had been his reply.
It was no doubt true that he thought of her before the child;
whether he thought of her first of all was much more open to
question. "She depends on me so much," she had urged,
sounding even to herself rather conventional. Did little
Margaret really depend on her so much&mdash;that demure prim
child, self-centred, busy in a world of her own with her
fancies and her toys? She was shy and reserved, she neither
gave nor seemed to expect demonstrations of affection. She
was her father's daughter and promised to grow up like him in
mind, as she already showed a physical likeness. The natural
bond existed between mother and child and was felt. It was
not strengthened by any congeniality of disposition, nor by
the tender appeal of frailty or sickness&mdash;despite that doctor's
advice, Margaret was robust and healthy. They did not see
much of one another really, not even at Hilsey. There was so
much to do. Bernadette was not a habit in her child's life
and doings; she was an interlude, and probably not seldom
an interruption. Still there they were&mdash;mother and child.
And the child would grow up, understand, and remember.
No woman could make light of all that; if Oliver thought she
could, he did her gross injustice. No, he who loved her would
not do her wrong. Then he must understand that duty to the
child was a great thing with her. And yet he said there ought
to be a greater!</p>

<p>At the back of her mind, unacknowledged, was a thought
which offered a sop to conscience. She would not be leaving
Margaret to strangers. Besides the father, there would be
Judith. The little girl was very fond of Judith, and Judith of
her. They seemed to understand one another; Margaret's
tranquil demureness fitted in with Judith's dry humour and
unemotional ways. The natural thing&mdash;under certain circumstances&mdash;would
be for Judith to take over the charge of her
uncle's house. "Just as if I were to die, you know," thought
Bernadette.</p>

<p>Besides, all this assumed that she would go away. Of
course Oliver wanted that, but&mdash;well, lots of women didn't.
Nice women too, some of them, and good mothers. She could
think of two or three at least among her own acquaintance,
and recognised now, with a sort of surprise and relief, that she
had never thought very particularly the worse of them for
their peccadillo; she had never shunned their society. Who
did&mdash;although everybody knew the facts? It was odd what a
difference there was between the official view (so to speak) and
the way people actually behaved about the matter; Oliver
had been quite right on that point&mdash;and even rather amusing.</p>

<p>She was seeing Oliver Wyse almost daily now, and their
meeting was the event of the day to her&mdash;anticipated, waited
for, feared. Everything else stood in relation to it&mdash;as a means
or a hindrance, as a dull contrast or a merciful relief. He
found her eager and excited, he left her often weary and fretful;
but by the next day she was eager again. She was like a
man who drinks himself into a headache and sadly grows sober,
only to drink once more.</p>

<p>The eve of the household's departure to the country had
come. They were to go on the morrow; as matters were
arranged, Oliver Wyse would join them two days later. After
another ten days, Arthur was due at Hilsey for his visit, and
two or three friends besides for a week-end. So stood the
programme&mdash;externally. But one point in it still hung in
doubt, even externally. Sir Oliver had a competing engagement&mdash;some
important business on the Continent; should he
give up the business and come to Hilsey? Or the other
way? He put the question to her, when he came to take
leave of her&mdash;whether for three days, or for how much
longer?</p>

<p>The time had passed when he could say, "It will wait."
That had been right when he said it; to hurry matters then
would have been to fail. But she had been brought to a point
when a decision could be risked. Risked it must be, not only
because his feelings ardently demanded an end to his suit, but
lest he should become ridiculous in his own eyes. Dangling
and philandering were not to his taste. He had got a dangerous
notion into his head&mdash;that she would keep him hanging
on and off to the end of the chapter. He had often seen men
cheated like that, and had laughed at them. His passion was
strong in him now, but his masculine pride was equal to fighting
it. He had himself on the curb. He could and would
leave her unless he could stay on his own terms. To tell her
that might involve cruelty to her; he did not stand on the
scruple. There were scruples enough and to spare, if a man
began to reckon them, in an affair of this kind. They were in
the nature of the case. What animal can live and thrive
that does not add cunning to courage, trickery to daring?
He liked neither being cruel to her nor tricking those about
her; but for the moment these things had to be done. There
should be an end of them soon; he promised himself that and
found comfort in the promise.</p>

<p>But she fought him with a pertinacity that surprised him;
he had not in his heart expected so stout a resistance.</p>

<p>"It's not in the least for me to decide whether you come to
Hilsey or not," she told him roundly. "It's entirely for you.
I ask you to pay me a visit. Come or not as you like, Sir
Oliver."</p>

<p>"But what does it mean if I do come?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'm not a prophet."</p>

<p>He put on no melodramatic airs. His manner was quiet and
friendly still. "You're a very provoking woman." He smiled.
"I hate to be abrupt&mdash;well, I don't think I have been&mdash;but
this thing's got to be settled."</p>

<p>"Has it? Who says so? What is there to settle?"</p>

<p>"You're being tempestuous now." He threw her own word
back at her, with a laugh. "And you know quite well what
there is to settle." He looked at her stormy little face with
love and tender amusement. But his answer he meant to
have.</p>

<p>"Settle, settle, settle! How many thousand times have
you used that word? I think I hate you, Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"I begin to think myself that you don't love me. So I'd
best be off on my business."</p>

<p>"Yes, I really think you had. And when you come back,
perhaps we can consider&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me, no, we can't!"</p>

<p>She looked at him for an instant. Again he made her eyes
dim. He hated himself at the moment, but it seemed to him
that there was nothing to do but stick to his course. Else,
whatever he felt now, he would feel to-morrow that she had
fooled him. She sat looking very forlorn, her handkerchief
clenched in her hand, ready to wipe away the tears. He went
and leant over her.</p>

<p>"Dearest, forgive me. You must think how I feel. Can't
you love and trust me?"</p>

<p>She thrust her hand confidingly into his: "I think I wish
you'd just be friends, Oliver."</p>

<p>An impulse of remorse struck him. "I think I wish I
could," he said ruefully.</p>

<p>"Then why not?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't understand&mdash;and I think you can't love
me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I'm sure I do."</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her. She was thinking, and let
the caress pass as though unnoticed.</p>

<p>"I don't think I could manage life now without you."</p>

<p>"Well, doesn't that mean&mdash;? Come, it just needs a little
courage."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk as if I were going to the dentist's!" But
she gave the hand she held an affectionate squeeze; her anger
had passed. "I suppose I've got to do it," she went on. "I
suppose I have. It's rather an awful thing, but I'm&mdash;I'm in a
corner. Because I do love you&mdash;and, yes, I'm a coward.
It's such an awful plunge, and there's&mdash;oh, everything against
it! Except just you, of course. Oliver, I don't think I can
come away."</p>

<p>He said nothing; he gently pressed her hand in encouragement.</p>

<p>She looked up at him and whispered, "Must I come away&mdash;now,
directly?"</p>

<p>"Soon at all events."</p>

<p>"I must go down to Hilsey to&mdash;to see Margaret, you know,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, go. Make an excuse to come up from there, and
I'll meet you."</p>

<p>"As if I should dare to do it without you to help me! You
must come to Hilsey too, Oliver, and we&mdash;we'll start from
there."</p>

<p>It was a fluttering faltering consent, but a consent it was;
though still deferred, it was definite. It agreed not only to
give him what he wanted, but to give it in the way he liked&mdash;openly,
before the world. The short delay&mdash;to be spent
largely in her company&mdash;weighed lightly against all this.
He caught her in his arms in gratitude and passion, pouring
out endearing words, beyond himself in exultation because
"it was settled."</p>

<p>Now at last she too was moved to the depths of her nature.
She sat clinging to him, with his strong arms about her, very
quiet, smiling, yet drawing her breath in long low pants, her
dim eyes very tender and never leaving his. So she heard his
half-whispered protestations and encouragement, smiling at
them, just now and then murmuring a faint "Yes." Her fears
were silenced, her scruples scattered to the winds while she
sat thus.</p>

<p>It was strange when that same evening (on which, she thanked
heaven, she had no engagement) she sat&mdash;quite otherwise&mdash;at
the head of her table with her husband opposite, Judith Arden
and Arthur Lisle on either side&mdash;a little family party, a little
domestic structure, so to say, of which she was the keystone
and which she was about to shatter. Yet it seemed so firm, so
habitual, the manner of its life so inveterate. Even Arthur,
the latest comer, was like a native part of it now. Its permanence
had looked so assured a few short weeks ago, when
Oliver's infatuation was a thing to smile over in amused secrecy.
But it was not permanent. She was going, by an arbitrary
exercise of power, to end it. Nay, she was going to end herself,
the self she had been all these last years&mdash;Godfrey's wife,
Margaret's mother, Mrs. Lisle of Hilsey and of Hill Street, W.
This woman, with all her various functions and relations, was
going to disappear, like a bit of fluff blown into the air. Enter&mdash;through
a somewhat stormy passage&mdash;a new woman, utterly
different and conditioned absolutely otherwise, a person of
whom Mrs. Lisle really knew very little, though she reached
out to the comprehension of her and to the vision of her life
with an ache of curiosity.</p>

<p>The other three&mdash;that all unconscious trio&mdash;were in good
spirits. Even Godfrey was cheerful at the prospect of escaping
from London and talked quite gaily. Judith was looking
forward to seeing Margaret and to the country pursuits she
loved; her talk was of riding, fishing, and tennis. Arthur
was gleeful; the short separation seemed but to flavour the
prospect of long and blissful days at Hilsey. Bernadette herself
was the most silent of the party, a thing quite contrary
to her wont. She sat there with a queer attractive sense of
power&mdash;in kind perhaps like what they say has sometimes
tempted men to secret murder&mdash;as though she dispensed fate
to her companions and disposed of their lives, though they
knew nothing of it. About them, even as about the new
woman who was to come into being, her dominant feeling was
not compunction but curiosity. How would they take it?
Imagine them at dinner at Hilsey&mdash;say this day three weeks
or this day month! Three, not four, at table, and Mrs. Lisle
of Hilsey not merely not there, but for all purposes important
for them non-existent! An exultation mingled now with her
eager curiosity. She marvelled that she had courage to wave
the mystic wand which was to destroy the structure. She
looked on the three with an ironical pity.</p>

<p>"Well, you all sound as if you were going to enjoy yourselves,"
she said, at last breaking her silence. "Have you
made any plans for me?"</p>

<p>"You always like the garden, don't you, Bernadette?"
Godfrey's tone was propitiatory.</p>

<p>"Oh, you must play tennis this year&mdash;and there'll be
the new car!" said Judith.</p>

<p>"Among other things, you're going to play golf with me.
You promised! The links are only about eight miles off. We
can motor over and make a jolly long day of it." Arthur's
sentence would have gained significance by the addition of
one more word&mdash;"together."</p>

<p>"I see you've settled it all among you," she said. "But
aren't you forgetting our guest? While you and I are doing
all this, what's to become of Sir Oliver?"</p>

<p>Arthur looked round the table with brows raised and a
gaily impudent smile. He felt pretty safe of the sympathy of
two of his audience; he was confident that the third would
pardon his presumption because of the hint that lay beneath
it&mdash;the hint that anything which interfered with long days
together would be unwelcome.</p>

<p>"For my part, I can't think what you want with your old
Sir Oliver at all," he said.</p>

<p>His speech came as a cap to the situation, a savoury titbit
for her ironical humour. She looked at him for a moment
with eyes that sparkled maliciously; then she broke into low
long laughter. She seemed unable to stop or control it. She
sat and laughed at all of them&mdash;and most of all at Cousin
Arthur. He&mdash;they&mdash;it&mdash;all too absurd!</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry!" she gasped at last, for their faces began
to grow astonished. "But it strikes me as very funny. If
he could hear you! Because he thinks a good deal of himself,
you know&mdash;my old Sir Oliver!"</p>

<h2>THE BATTLE WITH MR. TIDDES</h2>


<p>The next day there occurred to Arthur Lisle&mdash;whose
mind was a thousand miles away from such things&mdash;a
most unexpected event. The news of it came by
telephone from Henry, who ventured to bespeak Mr. Lisle's
immediate attention; he was not quite sure that he would
get it, so reprehensibly neglectful had Mr. Lisle's professional
conduct been of late. A brief had arrived, not somebody
else's to be 'held,' but actually for Arthur himself&mdash;a brief
in the Westminster County Court. The case would come on
for trial in two days' time.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to send the brief back, to fly from it;
not so much now because it frightened him as because it
clashed with the whole present temper of his mind. But full
as he was of fancies and vanities, he had somewhere a residuum
of sober sense. Did he really mean to turn his back on work,
to abandon his profession? Not merely to neglect preparation
and opportunities, as he had been doing, but to refuse
work actually there? That was a different thing&mdash;a decision
too momentous. If he refused this brief, he would scarcely
dare to show himself at his chambers, to face Henry again.
He braced himself up, and in a mixture of apprehension,
annoyance, and surprise, took his way to the Temple&mdash;instead
of going down to Wimbledon to watch lawn-tennis.</p>

<p>Henry welcomed the Prodigal, quite forgetful apparently
of that unfortunate episode of the Law Reports. "It's from
Wills and Mayne," he said. "Mr. Mayne brought it himself,
and said a clerk would be at the court on Friday to look after
you."</p>

<p>"But who are they? Do you know them, Henry?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I never heard of them. They're not clients of
Mr. Norton Ward's. But Mr. Mayne seemed to know about
you. A shortish gentleman, grey and rather bald&mdash;one of
his eyelids sort o' trembles, something like as if he was
winking."</p>

<p>"Hum!" He did not identify the stranger. "How the
deuce did they ever hear of me?" Because although Arthur
might have been cutting a figure in society, and certainly was
a person to whom notable things of a romantic order had
been happening, he was, as a member of the Bar, very young
and monstrously insignificant. "Well, it beats me!" he
confessed as he untied the tape which fastened <i>Tiddes v.
the Universal Omnibus Company, Ltd.</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Tiddes, it appeared (for of course Arthur dashed at
the brief and read it without a moment's delay), had a grievance
against the Universal Omnibus Company, Ltd., in that
they had restarted their 'bus while he was still in process of
alighting, thereby causing him to fall in the roadway, to
sprain his thumb, bark his knee, and tear his trousers, in
respect of which wrongs and lesions he claimed forty pounds
in damages. The Omnibus Company said&mdash;well, according
to their solicitors, Messrs. Wills and Mayne, they did not seem
to have very much to say. They observed that their clients
were much exposed to actions of this sort and made it their
policy to defend them whenever possible. The incident, or
accident, occurred late on Saturday night; Mr. Tiddes had
been in company with a lady (whom he left in the 'bus), and
had struck the conductor as being very animated in his demeanour.
Counsel would make such use of these facts as his
discretion dictated. In short, a knowledge of our national
habits made falling off a 'bus late on Saturday night in itself a
suspicious circumstance. Add the lady, and you added suspicion
also. Add an animated demeanour, and the line of
cross-examination was clearly indicated to counsel for the
defendants.</p>

<p>Not a clerk but Mr. Mayne himself met Arthur at the court;
he was recognisable at once by the tremor of his eyelid&mdash;like a
tiny wink, a recurring decimal of a wink. He was, it seemed,
rather pessimistic; he said it was a class of case that the
Company must fight&mdash;"Better lose than not defend"&mdash;and
Mr. Lisle must do his best. Of course the jury&mdash;and plaintiff
had naturally elected to have a jury&mdash;would find against the
Company if they could; however Mr. Lisle must do his best.
Arthur said he would. He longed to ask Mr. Mayne how the
deuce the firm had ever heard of him, but judiciously refrained
from thus emphasising his own obscurity. Also he strove
not to look frightened.</p>

<p>He was frightened, but not so frightened as he would have
been in the High Court. Things were more homely, less august.
There was no row of counsel, idle and critical. His Honour
had not the terrors of Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j</span>., and counsel for the plaintiff
was also young at the job, though not so raw as Arthur.
But the really lucky thing was that Mr. Tiddes himself made
Arthur furiously angry. He was a young man, underbred
but most insufferably conceited; he gave his evidence-in-chief
in a jaunty facetious way, evidently wishing to be considered
a great buck and very much of a ladies' man. With
this air he told how he had spent the Saturday half-holiday&mdash;he
was in the drapery line&mdash;at a cricket-match, had met the
young lady&mdash;Miss Silcock her name was&mdash;by appointment at
a tea-shop, had gone with her to a "Cinema," had entertained
her to a modest supper, and in her company mounted the
'bus. It was at her own request that he got out, leaving her
to go home unattended. His manner conveyed that Miss
Silcock's had been a stolen spree. Then came his story of the
accident, his physical sufferings, his doctor's bill, and his
tailor's account; finally the hard-hearted and uncompromising
attitude of the Company was duly exhibited.</p>

<p>Arthur rose to cross-examine&mdash;the moment of a thousand
dreams and fears.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Tiddes&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"<i>At</i> your service, sir," interposed Mr. Tiddes in jaunty and
jocular defiance.</p>

<p>"I want to follow you through this very pleasant evening
which you seem to have had. I'm sure we're all very sorry
that it ended badly."</p>

<p>"Very unselfish of <i>you</i> to look at it like that, Mr. Lisle,"
said His Honour. (Laughter in Court.)</p>

<p>Follow Mr. Tiddes he did through every incident of the
evening, with a curiosity especially directed towards the
refreshments of which Mr. Tiddes had partaken. With subtle
cunning he suggested that in such company as he had been
privileged to enjoy Mr. Tiddes would be lavish&mdash;his hand
would know no stint. As a matter of fact, Mr. Tiddes appeared
to have done things well. The "tea-shop" sold other commodities,
such as a glass of port. Next door to the "Cinema"
was a saloon buffet and Mr. Tiddes admitted a visit. At
supper they naturally took something&mdash;in fact bottled ale for
Miss Silcock, and whiskey-and-soda for Mr. Tiddes.</p>

<p>"One whiskey and soda?" asked counsel for the defence.</p>

<p>"Yes, one," said Mr. Tiddes. "At least I think so. Well&mdash;I
believe I did have a split, besides."</p>

<p>"Split whiskey or split soda?" (Laughter in Court.)</p>

<p>His Honour lolled back in his chair, smiling. Evidently
he thought somebody a fool, but Arthur could not be sure
whether it was himself or Mr. Tiddes. But he did not much
care. He had warmed to his work, he had forgotten his fears.
He could not bear that Mr. Tiddes should defeat him; it had
become a battle between them. Once or twice Mr. Tiddes had
winced, as over that 'split'&mdash;an arrow in the joints of his
harness! He was less jaunty, less facetious.</p>

<p>At last they got to the accident. Here Mr. Tiddes was very
firm. He made no concessions; he walked (so he maintained)
from his place in a perfectly quiet, sober, and business-like
manner, and in like manner was about to descend from the
'bus when&mdash;on it moved and he was jerked violently off! If
the conductor said anything to the contrary&mdash;well, the conductor
was not looking at the critical moment; he was collecting
somebody's fare.</p>

<p>"You didn't even look back at the young lady over your
shoulder?"</p>

<p>"I did not, sir." Mr. Tiddes too was, by now, rather angry.</p>

<p>"Didn't kiss your hand or anything of that sort?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, sir."</p>

<p>"In fact you were attending entirely to what you were
doing?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Don't you think, then, that it's rather odd that you should
have been jerked off?"</p>

<p>"The 'bus moved suddenly, and that jerked me off."</p>

<p>"But you were holding on, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was holding on all right."</p>

<p>So they went on wrangling, till His Honour ended it by
remarking, "Well, we've got his story, I think, Mr. Lisle.
You will have your opportunity of commenting on it, of
course." Upon which Arthur sat down promptly.</p>

<p>But he was dissatisfied. It was no more than a drawn
battle with Mr. Tiddes. If Mr. Tiddes's refreshments had
been shown to border on excess, there was nothing to show that
they had affected the clearness of his mind or the stability of
his legs. That was what Arthur was fishing for&mdash;and pure
fishing it was, for the conductor had in fact had his back
turned at the critical moment when Mr. Tiddes left the 'bus&mdash;somehow.
Also he was between Mr. Tiddes and the only
other passenger (Miss Silcock herself excepted). He had reached
backwards to give the signal to start&mdash;assuming that Mr.
Tiddes was already safely off. Negligent, perhaps&mdash;but why
was Mr. Tiddes not safely off by then? That question stuck
in Arthur's mind; but he had got no answer to it out of Mr.
Tiddes. The plaintiff insisted that no human being could have
got off in the time allowed by that negligent conductor.</p>

<p>Miss Silcock confirmed her friend's story, but in rather a
sulky way. It was not pleasant to have the stolen spree
dragged to light; she had "had words" with her mother,
to whom she had originally represented the companion of her
evening as belonging to the gentler sex; she was secretly of
opinion that a true gentleman would have forgone his action
in such circumstances. Arthur had hopes of Miss Silcock and
treated her very gently&mdash;no suggestion whatever that her
conduct was other than perfectly ladylike! Miss Silcock was
quite in a good humour with him when they got to the moment
when Mr. Tiddes bade her good night.</p>

<p>"You were at the far end of the 'bus. He said good night,
and walked past the conductor?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When did the 'bus stop?"</p>

<p>"When he was about half-way to the door."</p>

<p>"What did he do?"</p>

<p>"Walked to the door."</p>

<p>"Had the 'bus started again by then?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You could see him all the time? Where was he when the
'bus started again?"</p>

<p>"On the platform outside the door."</p>

<p>"Was he holding on to anything?"</p>

<p>Miss Silcock looked a little flustered. "I don't remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, but try, Miss Silcock," said His Honour soothingly,
but sitting up straight in his chair again.</p>

<p>"Well, no, I don't think he was. He'd turned round."</p>

<p>"Oh, he <i>had</i> turned round!" said Arthur, with a quite
artistic glance at the jury.</p>

<p>"Well, he just turned and smiled at me&mdash;sort o' smiled
good night."</p>

<p>"Of course! Very natural he should!"</p>

<p>"But he didn't seem to remember having done it," observed
His Honour.</p>

<p>"Did he do anything besides smile at you?" asked
Arthur.</p>

<p>"No, I don't think&mdash;&mdash;" She smiled and hesitated a
moment.</p>

<p>"Think again, Miss Silcock. You'd had a very pleasant
evening together, you know."</p>

<p>Miss Silcock blushed a little, but was by no means displeased.
"Well, he did cut a sort of caper&mdash;silly-like," she admitted.</p>

<p>"Oh, did he? Could you show us what it was like?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't <i>show</i> you," answered Miss Silcock, with a slight
giggle and a little more blush. "He lifted up one leg and kind
of wiggled it in the air, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just then the 'bus went on again, is that it?"</p>

<p>"Well, just about then, yes." Miss Silcock had caught a
look&mdash;such a look!&mdash;from her friend, and suddenly became
reluctant.</p>

<p>"While he was on one leg?"</p>

<p>Miss Silcock, turned frightened and remorseful, was
silent.</p>

<p>"Answer the question, please," said His Honour.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose so. Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Silcock. No more questions."</p>

<p>Re-examination could not mend matters. The evidence
for the defence came to very little. Counsel's speeches call
for no record, and His Honour did little more than observe
that, where Mr. Tiddes and Miss Silcock differed, the jury
might see some reason to think that Miss Silcock's memory of
the occurrence was likely to be the clearer and more trustworthy
of the two. The jury thought so.</p>

<p>"We find that the conductor started the 'bus too soon, but
that the plaintiff oughtn't to have been behaving like he was,"
said the foreman.</p>

<p>"That he wouldn't have tumbled off but for that, do you
mean?" asked His Honour.</p>

<p>After a moment's consultation, the foreman answered
"Yes."</p>

<p>"I submit that's a verdict of contributory negligence,
your Honour," said Arthur, jumping up.</p>

<p>"I don't think you can resist that, Mr. Cawley, can you?"
His Honour asked of counsel for the plaintiff. "Judgment for
the defendants with costs."</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Tiddes! He was purple and furious. It is sadly
doubtful if he ever again gave Miss Silcock a pleasant evening-out.</p>

<p>The case was won. Mr. Cawley was disconsolate. "Fancy
the girl letting me down like that!" he said, in mournful contemplation
of the untoward triumph of truth. Mr. Mayne,
winking more quickly than usual, was mildly congratulatory.
"The result will be very satisfactory to the Company. Just
the sort of thing which shows their policy of fighting is right!
Good afternoon, Mr. Lisle, and thank you." And there was
Henry, all over smiles, waiting to applaud him and to carry
home his blue bag. Arthur had a suspicion that, if he had
lost, Henry would have disappeared and left him to carry the
bag back to the Temple himself.</p>

<p>He was exultant, but he was not satisfied. As he strolled
back to his chambers, smoking cigarettes, a voice kept saying
in his ear, "You ought to have got it out of Tiddes! You
ought to have got it out of Tiddes!" Ought he? Could he?
Had Tiddes been lying, or was his memory really misty?
Arthur did not know even now, though he favoured the former
alternative. But oughtn't he to know? Oughtn't he to have
turned Mr. Tiddes inside out? He had not done it. Tiddes
would have beaten him, but for Miss Silcock. True, he had
persevered with Miss Silcock because his mind had gone to the
mysterious point in the case&mdash;why Mr. Tiddes was just ten
seconds or so too long in getting off the 'bus. But could he&mdash;or
couldn't he&mdash;have been expected to think of that capering
silly-like?</p>

<p>Between exultation and dissatisfaction his mind was tingling.
He fought the fight over and over again; he was absolutely
engrossed in it. He was back in the Temple before he
knew it almost&mdash;sitting in his chair by the fire, with a pipe,
trying to see what he could have asked, how he could have
broken down Mr. Tiddes's evidence. A pure triumph might
have left him pleased but careless. This defeat in victory
sharpened his feelings to a keen interest and curiosity. What
were the secrets of the art of wresting the truth from unwilling
witnesses? The great art of cross-examination&mdash;what were
its mysteries?</p>

<p>At any rate it was a wonderful art and a wonderful thing.
Very different from the dreary reading of Law Reports! There
was a fascination in the pitting of your brain against another
man's&mdash;in wringing the truth (well, if what you wanted to get
happened to be the truth) from his reluctant grasp. It was
Battle&mdash;that's what it was.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he cried within himself&mdash;indeed he could not
tell whether he uttered the words out loud or not&mdash;"There's
something in this beastly old business after all, if only I can
stick to it!"</p>

<p>Oblivious for the moment of everything else, even of Hilsey,
even of his adoration, he vowed that he would.</p>

<p>All this was the doing of quiet old Mr. Mayne with his
winking eyelid. Why had he done it? That too Arthur now
forgot to ask. He remembered nothing save the battle with
Mr. Tiddes. He had tasted blood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h2>THE MAN FOR A CRISIS</h2>


<p>Serious trouble threatened the Sarradet household
also&mdash;not of the sort which impended over the Lisles,
but one not less common. There was increasing strife
between father and son. Raymond's taste for pleasure showed
no sign of being sated; he took no warning from the scrape
out of which Sidney Barslow's strong arm had rescued him;
he spared neither time nor money in seeking the delights to
which his youth and his temperament inclined him. Old Mr.
Sarradet was ageing; he grew more grumpy and crusty,
fonder of his hoards, less patient when he saw money wasted,
more fearful of leaving the family business at the mercy of a
spendthrift. He grumbled and scolded; he made scenes.
Raymond met them with sullen hostility, or took to avoiding
them by absenting himself from the house. If home were
made uncomfortable, there were plenty of other places to go
to! The more his father would bridle him, the more he
kicked.</p>

<p>Marie tried to hold them together, to patch up quarrels, to
arrange truces, to persuade each of them to meet the other
half-way. Her task was the more difficult since she herself
was held as a threat over her brother's head. She should have
the hoards, she should have the business, unless Raymond
would mend his ways! The old man's menace turned her
brother's anger against her; almost openly he accused her
of bad faith and hypocrisy&mdash;of aiming at stepping into his
shoes. The charge was cruel, for she loved him. But he made
a stranger and at last nearly an enemy of her. Once she had
hoped to work on him through Amabel Osling, but Amabel,
slighted in favour of more recent and more gaudy attractions,
stood now on her dignity and would make no approaches to
Raymond. She came to the house still, and was as friendly
as ever to father and daughter, but distant towards the son
on the rare occasions when she found him there. Joe Halliday
was no use in serious straits like these; he took everything
as it came, for others as well as for himself; his serenely
confident, "Oh, he's a young fool, of course, but it'll come all
right, you'll see," did not seem to Marie to meet the situation.
And Arthur Lisle? Her old feeling forbade the idea of troubling
Mr. Lisle with such matters; they would certainly grate
on him. Besides, he was&mdash;somehow&mdash;a little bit of a stranger
now.</p>

<p>It was Sidney Barslow's opportunity; he was well fitted to
use the chance that circumstances gave him. The strong will
which enabled him to put a curb on his own inclinations, so
soon as he had an adequate motive, made him a man to turn
to in distress. His past indulgences, in so far as they were
known or conjectured, themselves gave him authority. He
spoke of what he knew, of what he had experienced and overcome.
Seeing him, the old father could not deny that young
men might pass through a season of folly, and yet be sound at
heart and able to steady themselves after a little while. Raymond
could not call him a Puritan or an ignoramus, nor accuse
him of not understanding the temptations which beset
his own path.</p>

<p>Sidney was honest in his efforts. He felt a genuine remorse
for having set young Raymond's feet on the primrose path
along which they now raced at such dangerous speed. About
his own little excursions along the same track he felt no such
pangs of conscience; fellows were different; some could pull
up when they liked; he could. It seemed that Raymond
could not; therefore he repented of having started Raymond
at all, and recognised a duty laid on himself of stopping him
if possible. And the same motives which had enabled him to
forsake the dangerous path urged him to turn Raymond also
from it. Marie's approval had been his mark in the one case;
in the other it was her gratitude; in both her favour. The
pleasure he derived from seeing her trust him and lean on him
was something quite new in his life and appealed strongly to
his courageous and masculine temper. He would not fail
her, any more than he had failed her brother in his need.</p>

<p>And his reward? He knew very well what he wanted&mdash;if
only he could get it. He did not deal in doubts and hesitations.
He had not sacrificed his indulgences without being quite
sure of what he wanted in exchange. His mind, if primitive
and unrefined, was direct and bold. His emotions were of the
same simple and powerful type. Courting a girl was to him no
matter of dreaming, romancing, idealising, fearing, palpitating.
It was just a man seeking the mate that pleased him.</p>

<p>Marie was in no mood to be courted yet; her dream was
too recently dispelled, and her steady nature could not leap
to sudden change. But her eyes were on his strong qualities
again; she looked at him less through Arthur Lisle's spectacles;
that side of her which liked him could now assert
itself. She turned to his aid readily, and, with her shrewd
calculation seconding the impulse of friendship, made his
company seem as welcome for its own sake as for the services
it promised.</p>

<p>"You always bring a breath of comfort with you, Sidney,"
she told him gratefully.</p>

<p>Sidney was honest with her. "It's not much good. He
won't listen to me any more." He shook his head in puzzle.
"I can't think where he gets the money! You tell me the old
man has cut off supplies, but I know he races, and I know he
plays baccarat&mdash;and you may be sure he doesn't win on a
balance. Besides he&mdash;well, he must get through a good bit in
other ways. He must be raising the wind somehow. But it
can't last."</p>

<p>It could not. One day old Sarradet came home from
business almost collapsed. Men had come to his shop&mdash;his
cherished City shop, hoary with the respectability of a hundred-and-fifty
years, parading the 'Royal Warrant' of a
third successive Sovereign&mdash;asking where his son was, brandishing
writs, truculently presuming that Mr. Sarradet would
"set the matter right." One more vicious than the rest, a
jeweller, talked of false pretences and illegal pawning&mdash;not of
a writ or a settlement, but of a summons or a warrant. He
had been very savage, and the old man, ashamed and terrified,
had pushed him into his own private room and there heard his
ultimatum&mdash;the ring and the bangle, or their value, in twenty-four
hours, or an application to a magistrate. And where
was Raymond? He had not been home the night before. He
was not at the West End shop. The poor old fellow babbled
lamentations and threats&mdash;he would not pay, he had done
with the scoundrel, here was a pretty end to an honourable
life! When Marie knelt by him and put her arms about him,
he fairly burst into tears.</p>

<p>The world of reckless living and dishonest shifts&mdash;both
father and daughter were strangers to it. At her wits' end
Marie telephoned for Sidney Barslow. By the time he came,
she had got the old man to go to bed, weeping for his son, for
himself, for his money, utterly aghast at doings so mad and
disastrous. A pitiful sight! She met Sidney with tears in her
eyes, full of the dismal story. "What are we to do?" she
wailed, quite bereft of her usual composure and courage. The
thing was too difficult, too dreadful.</p>

<p>"The first thing is to find him," said Sidney in his quick
decisive way. He looked at his watch. "It's a bit too early
now; in a couple of hours' time I may be able to lay my
hands on him."</p>

<p>"Can you really? How? Oh, I was sure you'd be able to
help!"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Marie, I&mdash;er&mdash;know the ropes. I think
I can find him&mdash;or somebody who'll put me on his track."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's where you're such a help." How she was
pardoning those past indulgences! In her heart she was
thanking heaven for them, almost admiring them! Wrong as
they were, they taught a man things which made him ever so
useful to women in distress about prodigal sons and brothers,
"And what will you do when you do find him?"</p>

<p>"Frighten him pretty well to death, if I can," Sidney
answered grimly. "I fancy our friend the jeweller may turn
out a blessing in disguise. The news of criminal proceedings
will be a bit of a soberer. The young ass!" Because it was
so easy to enjoy yourself without being involved in criminal
proceedings! "But, I say, you know," he went on, "the
governor'll have to pay up."</p>

<p>"You must persuade him. I don't believe I can,
Sidney."</p>

<p>"Oh, you can do that right enough. After all, I don't
suppose it'll break him exactly. I daresay, though, the young
'un has run into a tidy lot. Still we can square 'em, I expect.
Don't look so awfully cut up, Marie."</p>

<p>"I was just off my head till you came." She held out both
her hands for him to grasp. "Thank you, thank you, thank
you, Sidney!"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Marie. And, look here, if I find him, I
shan't bring him here. I expect he and the old man get on
one another's nerves. There's a room at my place. I'll take
him there. You put some things in a bag for him, and I'll take
it."</p>

<p>"Will you? It would be better they shouldn't meet&mdash;with
father as he is."</p>

<p>"And you may be sure that when I've got him, I won't let
him go. And we'll see about the money to-morrow."</p>

<p>She was infinitely comforted, immensely grateful. If he
had sown wild oats, what wisdom he had gleaned from the
crop! A meeting between father and son just now might be
the end of all things, finally fatal! She packed the bag and
gave it to her trusted emissary. "What should we have done
without you!" was her cry again.</p>

<p>"Just leave it to me," he told her, his strong thick lips set
resolutely.</p>

<p>With the knowledge acquired in folly but tamed now to
the service of wisdom, morality, and the interests of the
Sarradet business, he found young Raymond without much
difficulty&mdash;and found him just in time. More than money
was giving out, more than strict attention to financial ethics
was in jeopardy. The little excitable fellow was pretty well
at the end of his tether physically also. His nerves were at
breaking strain. Pleasure had become a narcotic against
thought; if that alone would not serve, drink was called in as
an ally. On the verge of a collapse, he was desperately postponing
it by the surest way to make it in the end complete.</p>

<p>Sidney, robust of body and mind, beheld him with mingled
pity and contempt. He himself could have lived the life for
years with faculties and powers unimpaired, really not the
worse for it, save in his pocket and his morals; only prudential
considerations and newly awakened hopes had, on a cool
calculation, turned him from it. But Raymond, if he did not
land in jail first, would land in hospital speedily. Amidst the
jeers and sneers of the hardier denizens of those regions, Sidney
carried him to his own flat and put him to bed like a naughty
worn-out child.</p>

<p>In the morning came the lecture. "No end of a jawing!
I pitched it in hot and strong, I can tell you," Sidney subsequently
reported to Marie. Poor Raymond lay in bed with a
racking headache and trembling hands, and heard his sins
rehearsed and (worse still) his feebleness exhibited.</p>

<p>"You're not the chap for this kind of thing," Sidney told
him. "Chuck it, my boy! Seek milder delights. Oh, I know
it's a bit my fault in the beginning. But I thought you'd a
head on your shoulders and some sense in it. I'm not against
a bust now and then; but this sort of rot&mdash;&mdash;! And what's
this fool's business about a ring and a bangle? You're in
a pretty tight place there, young fellow."</p>

<p>Almost amid sobs the story of these unfortunate articles
of jewellery&mdash;bought on credit and pawned, by and with the
advice and consent of the donee, a few days later&mdash;came out.
Sidney brandished the terrors of the law; the figure of the
justly irate tradesman took on terrifying proportions. If only
that dread apparition, with its suggestion of policemen, of locked
doors and bolts shot home, of Black Maria and picking oakum&mdash;if
only that apparition could be exorcised, there was nothing
Raymond would not do, promise, and abjure. Sidney jeered
while he threatened and grinned while he preached, but he did
both to good purpose, with all the convincing knowledge and
experience of a reformed criminal at a revivalist meeting, with
all the zeal of a doctor whose reputation is staked upon a
cure.</p>

<p>Then the thorough-going long-headed man went off to his
own employers and arranged to begin his approaching summer
holiday immediately. That done, he tackled the writ-bearers
and the fearful apparition with the aid of a sharp lawyer of
his acquaintance. With threats of giving as much trouble as
possible in one hand, and promises of a composition in "spot
cash" in the other, the lawyer and he succeeded in reducing
the claims to manageable proportions; the pawnbroker,
himself a little uneasy under the lawyer's searching questions,
accepted a compromise. Things could be arranged&mdash;at a
price.</p>

<p>But the pain of that price to old Sarradet's thrifty soul!
To have to subtract from his hoards instead of adding to them,
sell stock instead of buying, to count himself so much the
poorer instead of so much the richer&mdash;the old merchant hated
it. It was Marie's task to wring the money out of him. And
even when he had been brought to the point of ransoming his
son, he ceased not to bewail the prospects of his beloved
business.</p>

<p>"I won't leave it to him, I won't," he declared querulously.
"I'll leave it to you, Marie."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I couldn't possibly manage the business, Pops,"
she protested, half in dismay, half laughing at the idea.</p>

<p>"Then you must get a husband who can."</p>

<p>"Never mind my husband just now. There are more
pressing things than that."</p>

<p>An idea struck the old fellow. "I'll make it into a company.
I'll clip Master Raymond's wings for him!" He pondered over
this way of salvation, and, in light of its possibilities, gradually
grew a little calmer.</p>

<p>At last the wrench was over, the money paid. It was judged
to be safe for father and son to meet. Sidney brought the
rescued sinner to Regent's Park. Compunction seized them
at the sight of one another; the boy was so pale, shaken,
and contrite; the old man was thinner, aged, and feeble. The
old tenderness between them revived; each tried to console
the other. Quite resolved to protect his business, Mr. Sarradet
consented to forgive his son. Humbled to his soul, Raymond
asked no more than to be received back into favour on any
terms. Marie and Sidney stood by, helping, favouring, and
exchanging glances of self-congratulation.</p>

<p>"I'm off for my holiday to-morrow, Mr. Sarradet," Sidney
announced.</p>

<p>The old man looked up in sudden alarm. It was as if the
anchor announced to the ship that it proposed to take a holiday.</p>

<p>"No, no, that's all right! I'm going for a walking tour in
Wales, and Raymond's coming with me. Twenty miles a day,
open air all day! Three weeks of that, and he'll be as right as
rain, and ready to tackle his work like a Hercules!"</p>

<p>This clever fellow had a plan to meet every emergency!
Surely he would have a plan to save the beloved business too?
Mr. Sarradet determined to consult him about it when he
came back from Wales. Meanwhile he grew much more
cheerful, and even went so far as to indulge in some hints of a
giddy youth of his own&mdash;hints based (in cold truth be it said)
on a very slender foundation, but showing a desire to make
excuses for his son.</p>

<p>"Yes, and your bit of fun didn't do you any harm, Mr.
Sarradet, did it?" asked Sidney.</p>

<p>No more had his bit&mdash;though quite a large bit&mdash;done Sidney
harm. There was reason then to hope that even Raymond's
formidable bit might not in the end do Raymond any harm.
He might turn out as good a man of business as his father yet.
Still no risks should be run. The old gentleman hugged the
idea of his company&mdash;and he had someone in his eye for
Managing Director.</p>

<p>So with skill and courage, with good heart and kindliness,
with ambition and cunning, Sidney Barslow bound the Sarradet
family to his chariot wheels. He was the friend-in-need,
the rescuer, the saviour. He was like to become the sheet-anchor,
the arbiter, the referee. Between father and son&mdash;her
weak old man and her weaker young one&mdash;Marie could
not carry the whole load herself. She was strong and self-reliant,
but she was not strong enough for that. She too
would take the strong man's orders, though she might take
them with a smile, when what had been and what might have
been came to her remembrance.</p>

<p>He gave her an order now, when they said good night.</p>

<p>"Look here, when I bring him back from Wales, you
mustn't let him mope or be bored. If I were you, I'd get
Amabel to come and stay here a bit."</p>

<p>"Really you think of everything," she told him in a
merry wonder. "I'll ask her, of course."</p>

<p>"I think of a good many things," he said, venturing a bold
glance in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't think of too many at a time, Sidney," she warned
him with a smile.</p>

<p>"No, no, each in its proper place! One done, t'other come
on, you know!"</p>

<p>He stood looking down on her with a jovial confident smile&mdash;and
she liked it. His bold glance of admiration did not
displease or alarm her. She was quite ready to be told what
the glance said; but she was not ready to say anything in
reply yet. But it was evident that some day she would be
asked for a reply.</p>

<p>And it seemed evident too in what direction the current of
her life was setting. With a smile for this and a sigh for that,
and a wrinkle of the brow over this-and-that, she went back
to the drawing-room and gave old Sarradet his gin-and-water.</p>

<h2>A SHADOW ON THE HOUSE</h2>


<p>"So here you are&mdash;at Hilsey at last!" said Bernadette.</p>

<p>"Yes, and, I say, what a jolly old place it is!"
He paused for a moment. "I very nearly didn't
come at all, though."</p>

<p>She looked at him in amused surprise. "What was the
counter-attraction?"</p>

<p>"I had a job. Consequently it became wildly possible that
I might get another."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all? I hoped it was something interesting
and romantic."</p>

<p>"It is interesting&mdash;though I suppose it's not romantic."
In fact it had possessed for him some of the qualities implied
by that hard-worked word. "But my clerk can wire me if
anything turns up." He laughed at himself. "Nothing will,
you know, but it flatters my pride to think it might."</p>

<p>"It won't flatter my pride if you run away from us again."
She rose. "Get your hat and I'll show you round a bit. The
others are all out, doing something."</p>

<p>"Who's here?"</p>

<p>"Only the Norton Wards and Sir Christopher. Sir Oliver's
been here, but he had to go up on some business. He's
coming back in a few days. The others are here just for the
week-end."</p>

<p>"But I'm here for a month! Isn't that glorious?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know, something may happen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I shan't be sent for. I'm sure I shan't. Anyhow
I could come back, couldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you wanted to. The house would always be at
your disposal, Cousin Arthur." Her smile was mocking, but
she laid her hand on his arm with the old suggestion of a caress,
adding, "Let's get out and enjoy it, while we can, anyhow."</p>

<p>Bernadette looked a little pale and seemed rather tired&mdash;"run
down after the season," she had explained to Esther
Norton Ward when that lady commented on her appearance&mdash;but
Arthur was too joyfully excited, by meeting her again
and by his first view of Hilsey, to notice fine shades. It was
true that he had suffered a momentary hesitation about
coming&mdash;a passing spasm of conscience or ambition induced
by the great case of <i>Tiddes v. the Universal Omnibus Company,
Ltd.</i>&mdash;but that was all over with the sight of Bernadette and
of his stock's ancestral home. To see her there was to see the
jewel in its proper setting, or (to adopt Joe Halliday's hyperbole)
the angel in her own paradise. As they stepped out on
the lawn in front of the old house, he exclaimed, "It's beautiful,
and it fits you just perfectly! You were made for one
another!"</p>

<p>She pursed up her lips for a minute, and then laughed.
"Drink it in!" she said, jeering at his enthusiasm, and perhaps
at something else; the idea of an innate harmony
between herself and her husband's house seemed, to say the
least, far-fetched.</p>

<p>Whatever might be the case as to its mistress, Hilsey
deserved his praises. An old manor house, not very large, but
perfect in design and unimpaired by time or change, it stood
surrounded by broad lawns, bordered on the south side
(towards which the principal rooms faced) by a quick-running
river. The pride of the garden lay in the roses and the cedar
trees; amongst all the wealth of beauty these first caught
the eye. Within the house, the old oak was rich in carving;
the arms of the Lisles and of their brides, escutcheons and
mottoes, linked past and present in an unbroken continuity.
Grave gentlemen, and beauties, prim or provocative, looked
down from the panels. As he saw the staid and time-laden
perfection, the enshrined history, the form and presentment
of his ancestors, a novel feeling came to birth in Arthur Lisle,
a sense of family, of his own inalienable share in all this though
he owned none of it, of its claim on him. Henceforth, wherever
he dwelt, he would know this, in some way, for his true home.
He confessed to his feelings laughingly: "Now I understand
what it is to be a Lisle of Hilsey!"</p>

<p>"Imperishable glory!" But she was rather touched. "I
know. I think I felt it too when Godfrey brought me here
first. It is&mdash;awfully charming."</p>

<p>"I don't care for show-places as a rule. They expect too
much of you. But this doesn't. It's just&mdash;well, appealing
and insinuating, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's very genteel."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it's unquestionably very genteel too!" he
laughed.</p>

<p>The incomparable home and the incomparable cousin&mdash;his
mind wedded them at once.</p>

<p>"It was a stroke of genius that made Godfrey choose you
to&mdash;to reign here!"</p>

<p>Her smile was the least trifle wry now. What imp of perversity
made the boy say all the things which were not, at
this moment, very appropriate?</p>

<p>"Reigns are short&mdash;and rhapsodies seem likely to be rather
long, Arthur. I think I'll go and write a letter, and leave you
to simmer down a bit."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm an ass, I know, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and not only about the house!" She turned to leave
him, with a wave of her hand. "You'll get over all of it some
day."</p>

<p>He watched her slender white-frocked figure as she walked
across the lawn and into the porch. From there she looked
back, waving her hand again; he pictured, though he could
not at the distance see, the affectionate mocking little smile
with which she was wont to meet his accesses of extravagant
admiration, disclaiming what she accepted, ridiculing what she
let him see was welcome. His memory took an enduring
portrait of her there in the doorway of her home.</p>

<p>His heart was gay as he wandered about, "drinking it in,"
as Bernadette had bidden him. The sojourn before him seemed
an eternity full of delight. The future beyond that month was
indeed charged with interest; was there not the great farce,
was there not now the strange fact of Messrs. Wills and
Mayne, with whose aid imagination could play almost any
trick it pleased? Still these things admitted of postponement.
Arthur postponed them thoroughly, to fling himself into the
flood of present happiness.</p>

<p>His roving steps soon brought him to the banks of the
stream; he had been promised fishing there and was eager to
make an inspection. But he was to make an acquaintance
instead. On a bench by the water a little girl sat all by herself,
nursing a doll without a head, and looking across the
river with solemn steady eyes. Directly Arthur saw her
face he knew her for Margaret, sole daughter of the
house.</p>

<p>Hearing his step, the child turned towards him with a
rather apprehensive look, and hastily hid the headless doll
behind her back. She reminded him of her father so strongly
that he smiled; there was the same shy embarrassment; the
profile too was a whimsical miniature of Godfrey's, and her
hair was the colour of his&mdash;it hung very straight, without
curls, without life or riot in it.</p>

<p>"You're Margaret, aren't you?" he asked, sitting down by
her. She nodded. "I'm Cousin Arthur."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I knew you were coming."</p>

<p>"Why have you put dolly behind your back?"</p>

<p>"I thought you mightn't like her. Mummy says she's so
ugly."</p>

<p>"Oh, bring her out. Let's have a look at her! How did
she lose her head?"</p>

<p>"Patsy bit it off and ate it&mdash;at least she ate the face. It
made her sick."</p>

<p>"Who's Patsy?" He was glad that Margaret had now put
the doll back in her lap; he took that for a mark of confidence.
"Is she your dog?"</p>

<p>"No, she's Judith's; but she lives here always and Judith
doesn't. I wish Judith did."</p>

<p>"What's dolly's name?"</p>

<p>"Judith."</p>

<p>"I see you like Judith very much, don't you? The real
Judith&mdash;as well as dolly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very much. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very much." And then the conversation languished.
Arthur was only moderately apt with children, and Margaret's
words had come slowly and with an appearance of consideration;
she did not at all suggest a chatterbox. But presently
she gave him a look of timid enquiry, and remarked in a deprecating
way "I expect you don't like guinea-pigs. Most
people don't. But if you did, I could show you mine. Only
if you're sure you like guinea-pigs!"</p>

<p>Arthur laughed outright. For all the world, it was like the
way Godfrey had invited him down to Hilsey! The same
depreciation of what was offered, the same anxiety not to
force an unwilling acceptance!</p>

<p>"Guinea-pigs! I just love them!" he exclaimed with all
possible emphasis.</p>

<p>"Oh, well then!" said Margaret, almost resignedly, with a
sort of "Your blood be on your own head" manner, as she
jumped down and put her free hand into his; the other
held tight hold of the headless doll. "In the kitchen-garden!"</p>

<p>Over the guinea-pigs he made a little progress in her good
graces. She did not come out to meet a stranger with the
fascinating trustfulness of some children; she had none of
that confidence that she would be liked which makes liking
almost inevitable. She was not pretty, though she was refined.
But somehow she made an appeal to Arthur, to his chivalry&mdash;just
as her father did to his generosity. Perhaps she too had
not many friends, and did not hope for new ones.</p>

<p>When the guinea-pigs gave out, she made him no more
offers and risked no more invitations. In a grave silence she
led him back from the kitchen-garden to the lawn. He was
silent too, and grave, except for twitching lips. He saw that
she could not be "rushed" into intimacy&mdash;it would never do
to toss her up in the air and catch her, for instance&mdash;but he
felt that their first meeting had been a success.</p>

<p>A voice called from within a door adjacent to him: "Margaret,
your tea's ready." The child slipped her hand out of
his and ran in without a word. A minute passed, Arthur
standing where he was, looking at the old house. Judith came
out and greeted him.</p>

<p>"You've made an impression on Margaret," she told him,
smiling. "She said to me, 'I've shown Cousin Arthur my
guinea-pigs, and I <i>think</i> he's going to be nice.'"</p>

<p>"Guarded! At any rate, in the way you emphasise it."</p>

<p>"It's a lot from her, though, on so short an acquaintance."</p>

<p>He liked the look of Judith in country kit; she was dressed
for exercise and conveyed an agreeable suggestion of fresh air
and energy. "I'm all by myself; take me for a bit of a walk
or something."</p>

<p>"All right. We've time for a stroll before tea&mdash;it's always
late." She set off towards a little bridge which crossed the
river and led to a path through the meadows towards a fir
wood on rising ground beyond.</p>

<p>"How like the child is to Godfrey! I suppose they're very
devoted to one another?"</p>

<p>"Well, I think they are, really. But they rather need an
intermediary, all the same&mdash;somebody to tell Margaret that
her father wants her, and <i>vice versa</i>. My function, Arthur&mdash;among
others which you may have observed that I fulfil in the
course of your study of the household."</p>

<p>He laughed. "I don't think I have studied it. What is
there to study?"</p>

<p>"There's a good deal to study in every household, I expect."
They had scaled the hill and stood on the edge of the wood.
"There's a pretty view of the house from here," she said, turning
round.</p>

<p>"By Jove, how jolly and&mdash;and peaceful, don't you know?&mdash;it
all looks!"</p>

<p>Her eyes turned from the view to the young man's face.
She smiled, a little in scorn, more in pity. Because he really
seemed to identify the features of the landscape with the
household at Hilsey Manor&mdash;a most pathetic fallacy! But
he had always been blind, strangely blind, dazzled by the
blaze of his adoration. Yet she liked him for his blindness,
and conceived it no business of hers to open his eyes. Though
they were opened to a full glare of knowledge and sorrow, how
would that help?</p>

<p>To her own eyes there rested now a dark shadow over the
house, a cloud that might burst in storm. She felt a whimsical
despair about her companion. How he soared in a heaven of
his own making, with an angel of his own manufacture!
With what a thud he would come to earth, and how the angel
would moult her wings, if a certain thing happened! Oh,
what a fool he was&mdash;yet attractive in his folly! For the sake
of woman, she could almost love him for the love he bore
his Bernadette&mdash;who was not, by a long way, the real one.</p>

<p>"I'm rather glad Wyse isn't going to be here for a bit yet,"
said Arthur thoughtfully. "We shall be jollier by ourselves."</p>

<p>Queer that he should put a name so pat to the shadow
which he could not see!</p>

<p>"I like him all right, but he'd be rather in the way, wouldn't
he?"</p>

<p>Of a surety he was in the way&mdash;right plump in the middle
of it! There was sore doubt whether the family coach could
get by without a spill.</p>

<p>"Well, when he comes back, you mustn't expect to
monopolise Bernadette."</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever try to do that, do I?" he asked
quickly, flushing a little. "I mean, I don't set up to&mdash;well,
I don't make a bore of myself, do I?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, no! I suppose I meant that you mustn't mind
if Sir Oliver monopolises her rather."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I shall mind that!" cried Arthur in dismay.
Then he laughed. "But I'm hanged if he shall do it!
I'll put up a fight. What happened when he was here
before?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's her friend, you see, not mine or Godfrey's. So,
naturally, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did they do together?"</p>

<p>"Motored mostly."</p>

<p>"That'd mean she'd be out half the day!"</p>

<p>"Yes. All day sometimes."</p>

<p>By now they were strolling back. Arthur's spirits had
fallen somewhat; this man Wyse might be a considerable
bore! But then, when he was there before, there had been
nobody else&mdash;no other man except Godfrey, and no other
guest except Judith, who was almost one of the family. He
would not find things quite the same when he came back,
thought Arthur in his heart, sublimely sure that Bernadette
would not ill-use him. On this reflection his spirits rose again,
now spiced with combativeness. He would hold his own.</p>

<p>"How did he and Godfrey hit it off?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Godfrey just retired&mdash;you know his way."</p>

<p>"Into his shell? Doesn't he like Sir Oliver?"</p>

<p>"Does he like anybody&mdash;except me and you?" she asked,
smiling ruefully. "And I think that perhaps he likes Sir
Oliver rather less than most people. But it's not easy to tell
what he feels."</p>

<p>As a fact she had been much puzzled to know what
Godfrey had been thinking of late. He had said nothing
to her; she would readily swear that he had said nothing to
Bernadette. He had been just a little more silent, more
invisible, more solitary than usual. Of what was in his mind
she knew really nothing. The pall of his passivity hid it all
from her sight.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that his passivity did more than hide him&mdash;that
it must also to a great extent put him out of action,
render him negligible, neutralise him, if and when it came to
a fight. As an institution, as a condition, as a necessary part
of a certain state of things&mdash;in fine, as being Mr. Lisle of
Hilsey&mdash;he would no doubt, of necessity, receive attention.
In that aspect he meant and represented much&mdash;a whole
position, a whole environment, a whole life. Church and
state, home and society&mdash;Godfrey the Institution touched
them all. But Godfrey the man, the individual man&mdash;what
consideration, what recognition could he expect if he thus
effaced himself? If he put forward no claim, none would be
admitted. If he made a nonentity of himself, he would be
counted for naught. It might be urged that such had been the
position for years, and that, with all its drawbacks, it had
worked. The argument was futile now. A new and positive
weight in the other scale upset the balance.</p>

<p>"Well, do you like Sir Oliver yourself?" asked Arthur,
after some moments of silence.</p>

<p>She paused before answering. "Yes, I do," she said in
the end. "At any rate I rather admire him. There's a sort
of force about him. And&mdash;yes&mdash;I do like him too. You could
trust him, I think." Then it seemed to herself that this was
an odd thing which had come to her lips&mdash;under existing
circumstances. It was in explanation to herself, rather than
for Arthur's information, that she added, "I mean that, if he
undertook anything towards you, he'd carry it out; you might
rely on him."</p>

<p>"I don't want him to undertake anything towards me,"
said Arthur loftily.</p>

<p>"Oh, the people outside those limits must shift for themselves&mdash;I
think that would be entirely Sir Oliver's view.
But I'm not sure it's a wrong one, are you?" It was still
with her own thoughts that she was busy. She could not quite
understand why she was not more angry with Oliver Wyse.
She had no doubt by now of what he wanted. Surely it ought
to make her angry? She was pre-eminently Godfrey's friend&mdash;his
kinswoman, not Bernadette's. She ought to be terribly
angry. Even apart from moral considerations, family solidarity
and friendly sympathy united to condemn the trespasser.
She was loth to confess it to herself, but at the bottom of her
heart she doubted if she were angry at all with Oliver Wyse.
It was all so natural in him; you might almost say that he
was invited. Bernadette and Godfrey between them had set
up a situation that invited the intervention of a strong man
who knew what he wanted. Could the one complain with
justice of being tempted, or the other of being wronged? To
the friend and kinswoman her own impartial mind put these
searching questions.</p>

<p>"It's a view that I quite cheerfully accept as between
Oliver Wyse and myself," said Arthur. There was a note of
hostility in his voice, of readiness to accept a challenge. Then
he realised that he was being absurd; he had the grace often
to recognise that. He smiled as he added, "But, after all,
he's done me no harm yet, has he?"</p>

<p>The shadow hung over the house&mdash;aye, over his own head&mdash;but
he did not see it.</p>

<h2>FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON!</h2>


<p>Norton Ward on a country visit gave the impression
of a locomotive engine in a siding. His repose
was so obviously temporary and at the mercy of any
signal. He was not moving, but his thoughts were all of movement&mdash;of
his own moves, of other people's, of his counter-moves;
or of his party's moves, and the other party's counter-moves.
He could not at the moment be moulding and shaping
his life; but, like a sculptor, he was contemplating the clay
in the intervals of actual work, and planning all that he would
do, so soon as he could get at it again. Even in hours of idleness
he was brimful of a restless energy which, denied action
for the moment, found its outlet in discussing, planning,
speculating, making maps of lives, careers, and policies.</p>

<p>"You bring London down with you in your portmanteau,
Frank!" Sir Christopher expostulated. "We might be in
the Lobby instead of under the trees here on a fine Sunday
morning."</p>

<p>The old Judge lay back in a long chair. He was looking
tired, delicate, and frail, his skin pale and waxy; his hands
were very thin. He had arrived cheerful but complaining of
fatigue. The work of the Term had been hard; he was turned
seventy, and must think of retiring&mdash;so he told his hostess.</p>

<p>"It's so different," he went on, "when it comes to looking
back on it all, when it's all behind you. But, of course, men
differ too. I never meant business to the extent you do. I've
done pretty well; I won't cry down what is, after all, a fine
position. It was thought rather a job, by the way, making me
a judge, but I was popular and what's called a good fellow,
and people swallowed the job without making a fuss. But
work and what it brings have never been all the world to me.
I've loved too many other things, and loved them too much."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know I'm a climber," laughed Norton Ward. "I
can't help it. I try sometimes to get up an interest in some
dilettante business or other, but I just can't! I'm an infernal
Philistine; all that sort of thing seems just waste of time to
me."</p>

<p>"Well then, to you it is waste of time," said his wife.</p>

<p>"We must follow our natures, no help for it. And that's
what one seems to have done when one looks back. One gets
a little doubtful about Free Will, looking back."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but it's awfully hard to know what your nature
is," Arthur interposed. He was lying on the grass, pulling up
blades of it and tying them in knots for an amusement.</p>

<p>"It works of itself, I think, without your knowing much
about it&mdash;till, as I say, you can look back."</p>

<p>"But then it's too late to do anything about it!"</p>

<p>"Well, so it is, unless eternity is an eternity of education,
as some people say&mdash;a prospect which one's lower nature is
inclined to regard with some alarm."</p>

<p>"No amount of it will quite spoil you, Sir Christopher,"
Esther assured him with an affectionate smile.</p>

<p>"If this life can't educate a man, what can?" asked Norton
Ward.</p>

<p>"The view traditionally ascribed to Providence&mdash;with a
most distressing corollary!"</p>

<p>"I think, if a fellow's come a mucker, he ought to have
another chance," said Arthur.</p>

<p>"That's what my criminals always tell me from the dock,
Mr. Lisle."</p>

<p>"And what women say when they run away from their
husbands," added Norton Ward with a laugh. "By the way,
I was talking to Elphinstone the other day about the effect
this Divorce Reform movement might have if either party
really took it up in earnest, and he was inclined to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall we hear Sir John Elphinstone's views on this beautiful
morning?" asked the Judge.</p>

<p>Norton Ward laughed again&mdash;at himself. "Oh, I beg your
pardon! But after all it is some time since we touched on
anything of practical interest."</p>

<p>"If death and judgment aren't of practical interest, I'll
be hanged if I know what is!"</p>

<p>"But neither of them exactly of immediate interest, Judge,
we'll hope!"</p>

<p>"Well, what are you all talking about?" asked a voice
from behind the group. Bernadette stood there, with parasol
and prayer-book. She had been to church with Godfrey,
Margaret, and Judith.</p>

<p>"Death and judgment, Bernadette," said Esther.</p>

<p>"Not very cheerful! You might as well have come to
church, and dressed the family pew for us."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we were cheerful; we had just concluded that
neither threatened any of us at present."</p>

<p>Bernadette took a seat among them, facing Arthur as he
lay on the grass. She gave him a little nod of recognition;
she was especially glad to find him there, it seemed to say.
He smiled back at her, lazily happy, indolently enjoying the
fair picture she presented.</p>

<p>"It's very artistic of you to go to church in the country,
Bernadette," said the Judge. "It's so much the right thing.
But you always do the right thing. In fact I rather expected
you to go so far as to bring the parson back to lunch. That
was the ritual in my early days."</p>

<p>"I don't overdo things, not even my duties," smiled
Bernadette. She was looking very pretty, very serene, rather
mischievous. None the less, the parasol and the prayer-book
gave her an orthodox air; she was quite pronouncedly Mrs.
Lisle of Hilsey, sitting on her own lawn. After attending to
her religious duties and setting a good example, she was now
entertaining her house-party.</p>

<p>"The others have gone for a walk before lunch, but it's
much too hot for walking," she went on.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you promised to go for a walk with me this afternoon,
you know," cried Arthur.</p>

<p>"We'll go and sit together somewhere instead, Arthur."</p>

<p>"We're warned off! That's pretty evident," laughed
Norton Ward. "You shouldn't give her away before all of
us, Arthur. If she does make assignations with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If she does make assignations, she keeps them&mdash;no matter
who knows," said Bernadette. A little mocking smile hung
persistently about her lips as she sat there, regarded by them
all, the ornament of the group, the recipient of the flattery of
their eyes.</p>

<p>"If she made one with me," said Sir Christopher, "I don't
think I should be able to keep it to myself either. I should be
carried away by pride, as no doubt Mr. Lisle is."</p>

<p>"Would you kiss and tell, Sir Christopher?" smiled
Bernadette.</p>

<p>"Poets do&mdash;and such a kiss might make even me a poet."</p>

<p>"Evidently you'd better not risk it, Bernadette," laughed
Arthur.</p>

<p>"Well, it hasn't been the usual effect of my kisses," Bernadette
observed demurely.</p>

<p>The mischievous reference to her husband seemed obvious.
It forced a smile from all of them; Esther added a reproving
shake of her head.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's as well, because I don't think I should like
poets, not about the house, you know."</p>

<p>"Now tell us your ideal man, Bernadette," said the
Judge.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll tell each of you that in private!"</p>

<p>To Esther Norton Ward, who knew her well, there seemed
something changed in her. She was as serene, as gay, as
gracious as ever. But her manner had lost something of the
absolute naturalness which had possessed so great a charm.
She seemed more conscious that she exercised attraction, and
more consciously to take pleasure&mdash;perhaps even a little
pride&mdash;in doing it. She had never been a flirt, but now her
speeches and glances were not so free from what makes flirtation,
not so careless of the effect they might produce or the
response which might be evoked by them. To some degree
the airs of a beauty had infected her simplicity; graceful
and dainty as they were, to her old friend's thinking they
marred the rarer charm. She was not so childlike, not so free
from guile. But Esther did not suppose that the men would
notice any change; if they did, they would probably like it.
For being neither willing nor able to flirt herself, she was
convinced that men liked flirts. Flirts both flattered their
pride and saved them trouble. Perhaps there was some truth
in her theory.</p>

<p>For Esther's own eyes the change in Bernadette was there,
whether the men saw it or not. It was not obvious or obtrusive;
it was subtle. But it was also pervasive. It tinged her
words and looks with a provocativeness, a challenge, a consciousness
of feminine power formerly foreign to them. She
had meanings where she used to have none. She took aim at
her mark. She knew what she wanted to effect and used
means towards it. She no longer pleased herself and left her
pleasure itself to make her charming. This was not the old
Bernadette, Esther thought, as she watched her dexterously,
triumphantly, keeping the three men in play.</p>

<p>The men did notice, in varying degrees, though none with so
clear a perception as the woman. Norton Ward, not quick to
note subtleties in people and not curious about women, was
content with thinking that Bernadette Lisle seemed in remarkably
good form and spirits that Sunday&mdash;he observed on the
fact at a later date. The Judge, a shrewder and more experienced
observer in this line, smiled tolerantly at the way she
was keeping her hand in by a flirtation with her handsome
young kinsman by marriage; she was not a fool, and it would
do the boy good. Arthur too saw the change, or rather felt
it, as he would feel a variation in the atmosphere. He could
have given no such clear account of wherein it lay as Esther
had arrived at, nor any such simple explanation as served for
Norton Ward or Sir Christopher. Had he been pressed, he
might have said&mdash;doubtfully&mdash;that she seemed to have become
more his equal, and more like other women in a way, though
still infinitely more delightful. But, no man asking him to
analyse his feeling, he did not attempt the vain task. The
effect on him was there, whatever its explanation might be;
in some vague fashion it was as though she put out a hand to
raise him from the ground where he lay at her feet, his face
hidden, and graciously intimated that he might kneel before
her and dare to raise his eyes to hers. She treated him more
as a man and less as a pet&mdash;was that it? This was the idea
which came nearest to explicitness in his mind; the proud
pleasure with which he looked and listened had its source in
some such inkling as that. He had grown in the last few
months; both actually and in his own esteem he had developed;
a recognition of his progress from her would crown
the delight she gave him.</p>

<p>She saw not only the men's admiration, amused or dazzled;
she perceived also Esther's covert curiosity. She knew herself
that she felt different and was being different. Esther Norton
Ward knew it too! Very well, let her know. She did not know
the reason yet. That she would learn hereafter. She caught
Esther's pondering glance and met it with a smile of mutinous
merriment; Esther might have pondered with more chance
of enlightenment, had she been at Hilsey during the week that
Oliver Wyse had spent there!</p>

<p>"Why don't you use your influence with that young man
there and make him work?" asked Norton Ward of her.</p>

<p>"The wise woman uses her influence to make men do what
they want to do, but think they oughtn't. Then they worship
her, Frank."</p>

<p>"Oh, bosh! Henry's in despair about you, Arthur&mdash;he's
pathetic!"</p>

<p>"I like that!" cried Arthur indignantly. "Didn't he tell
you about my case? It was only in the County Court, of
course, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it! Henry said you were very promising, if you'd
only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you win a case, Arthur? Tell us about it."</p>

<p>Arthur told the story of his battle with Mr. Tiddes, and
how Miss Silcock betrayed the fortress.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" cried Bernadette, clapping her hands, her
eyes all sparkling. "Arthur, you shall defend me, the first
time I'm in trouble. Only I think I shall plead guilty, and
throw myself on the mercy of his lordship."</p>

<p>"You'd get none from me, you baggage!" said Sir Christopher,
who was wondering how the deuce any young fellow
could resist her.</p>

<p>"Call witnesses to character, anyhow. We'd all come,"
laughed Norton Ward.</p>

<p>"You'd all come as witnesses to my character?" Her
laugh came low but rich, hearty, charged with malicious
enjoyment. "I wonder if you would!"</p>

<p>"Witnesses to character don't help the prisoner very much,
and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred convict themselves&mdash;of
stupidity, which they invite the Judge to share. What
they really come to say is 'We've made a mistake about
this fellow all these years. He's been too clever for us!'
Why should that help him? I'm very careful about letting
that sort of thing interfere with my sentences."</p>

<p>"But oughtn't the prisoner to get a reward for past good
character, Sir Christopher? Because it may not have been
a case of deceiving his friends. He may have changed
himself."</p>

<p>"Well, it's the changed man I'm sentencing. Why shouldn't
he get it hot?"</p>

<p>"I shall not throw myself on the mercy of this particular
lordship," said Bernadette. "He hasn't got any, that's
obvious."</p>

<p>"No, you'd better get out of my jurisdiction."</p>

<p>"That would be the best thing to do, I think&mdash;get out of
the jurisdiction." She rose with a laugh. "Also I'm going to
get out of this church-going frock and into something cool and
comfortable for lunch." Before she went, she had a last word
for Sir Christopher. "The prisoner may have deceived himself
as well as his friends, mayn't he? And he may surprise himself
in the end just as much as he surprises them. Come along,
Arthur, and help me to make some hock-cup before I change&mdash;Barber's
no good at it."</p>

<p>The Judge looked after her as she walked away, attended
by Arthur. "That was rather an acute remark of hers," he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wonder what made her say it!" Esther was looking
puzzled and thoughtful again.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, we all of us make intelligent general observations
at times, Esther."</p>

<p>"I don't think Bernadette's much given to general observations,
though."</p>

<p>"Anyhow it's good to see her in such spirits," said Norton
Ward. "Rather surprising too, since you're talking of surprises.
Because between ourselves&mdash;and now that the family's
out of hearing&mdash;I may say that our host is even unusually
poor company just now."</p>

<p>"As Bernadette's very little in his company, that doesn't
so much matter."</p>

<p>"Esther, my dear, you sound rather tart," said Sir Christopher.
"Come and drink the hock-cup; it'll make you more
mellow."</p>

<p>Bernadette's gay and malicious humour persisted through
lunch, but when, according to her promise, she sat with Arthur
on the seat by the river, sheltered by a tree, her mood had
changed; she was very friendly, but pensive and thoughtful
beyond her wont. She looked at him once or twice as if she
meant to speak, but ended by saying nothing. At last she
asked him whether he has seen anything of the Sarradets lately.</p>

<p>"Not since my lunch&mdash;when you met Marie," he answered.
He was smoking his pipe and now and then throwing pebbles
into the river&mdash;placidly happy.</p>

<p>"I liked her awfully. You musn't drop her, Arthur. She's
been a good friend to you, hasn't she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's a rare good sort, Marie! I don't want to drop
her, but somehow I've got out of the way of seeing so much of
her. You know what I mean? I don't go where she does, and
she doesn't go much where I do."</p>

<p>"But you could make efforts&mdash;more lunches, for instance,"
she suggested.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I could&mdash;sometimes I do. But&mdash;well, it's just
that the course of my life has become different."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the course of your life means me to a certain
extent."</p>

<p>He laughed. "You began it, of course, when you came to
Bloomsbury Street. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember all right. But I don't want you to lose
your friends through me." Again she glanced at him in
hesitation, but this time she spoke. "You may find me a
broken reed, after all, Cousin Arthur."</p>

<p>He smoked for a moment, then laid down his pipe. "I'm
fond of you all," he said. "You know how well Godfrey and
I get on. I've made friends with Judith, and I'm making
friends with Margaret. And&mdash;we're too good pals to say much&mdash;but
you know what you are to me, Bernadette."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Cousin Arthur."</p>

<p>"So I don't know what you mean by talking about broken
reeds."</p>

<p>She gave a little sigh, but said no more for the moment.
She seemed to be on another tack when she spoke again.
"It's a wonderful thing to be alive, isn't it? I don't mean
just to breathe and eat and sleep, but to be alive really&mdash;to&mdash;to
tingle!"</p>

<p>"It's a wonderful thing to see in you sometimes," he
laughed. "Why, this morning, for instance, you&mdash;you seemed
to be on fire with it. And for no particular reason&mdash;except,
I suppose, that it was a fine day."</p>

<p>She smiled again as she listened, but now rather ruefully.
"For no particular reason!" She could not help smiling at
that. "Well, I hope I didn't scorch anybody with my fire,"
she said.</p>

<p>"You made us all madly in love with you, of course."</p>

<p>She gave him a little touch on the arm. "Never mind
the others. You mustn't be that, Cousin Arthur."</p>

<p>He turned to her in honest seriousness. "As long as you'll
be to me just what you are now, there's nothing to worry
about. I'm perfectly content."</p>

<p>"But suppose I should&mdash;change?"</p>

<p>"I shan't suppose anything of the sort," he interrupted
half-angrily. "Why should you say that?"</p>

<p>Her heart failed her; she could not give him further warning.
Words would not come to her significant enough without
being blunt and plain; that again she neither could nor would
be. Something of her malice revived in her; if he could not
see, he must remain blind&mdash;till the flash of the tempest smote
light even into his eyes. It must be so. She gave a little shrug
of her shoulders.</p>

<p>"A mood, I suppose! Just as I had a mood this morning&mdash;and,
as you say, for no particular reason!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h2>GOING TO RAIN!</h2>


<p>The departure of the Norton Wards and Sir Christopher
on Monday morning left Arthur alone with
the family party at Hilsey Manor. To live alone with a
family is a different thing from being one of a party of visitors.
The masks are off; the family life is seen more intimately,
the household politics reveal themselves to the intelligent outsider.
During the days which intervened between his own
arrival and that of Oliver Wyse, Arthur's eyes were opened to
several things; and first of all to the immense importance of
Judith Arden in the household. He soon found himself wondering
how it got on at all in the winter, when she was not
there; he had not yet known his cousins through a winter.
She was in touch with all three of them; her love for animals
and outdoor things made her in sympathy with the little girl;
her cheerfulness and zest for enjoyment united her with
Bernadette; her dry and satiric humour, as well as her interest
in books, appealed to Godfrey's temper. Thus she served, as
she herself had hinted to Arthur, as an intermediary, an
essential go-between; she was always building bridges and
filling up chasms, trying to persuade them that they had more
in common than they thought, trying to make them open
their hearts to one another, and distributing herself, so to say,
among them in the way best calculated to serve these ends.
Arthur soon observed with amusement that she aimed at
distributing him also fairly among the family&mdash;now assigning
him to Margaret, now contriving for him a walk with Godfrey,
then relinquishing him to Bernadette for a while, and thus
employing him, as she employed herself, as a link; their
common liking for him was to serve as a bond of union. It
was the task of a managing woman, and he would have said
that he hated managing women. But it was impossible to
hate Judith; she set about her task with so much humour,
and took him into her confidence about it not so much in words
as by quick amused glances which forbade him to resent the
way she was making use of him. Very soon he was sympathising
with her and endeavouring to help in her laudable endeavour
after family unity.</p>

<p>She still persevered in it, though she had little or no hope
left, and was often tempted to abandon the struggle to preserve
what, save for the child's sake perhaps, seemed hardly
worth preserving. Though she actually knew nothing of how
matters stood between Bernadette and Oliver&mdash;nothing either
of what they had done or of what they meant to do&mdash;though
she had intercepted no private communication, and surprised
no secret meetings, she was sure of what Oliver wanted and of
what Bernadette felt. The meaning of the change that puzzled
Esther Norton Ward was no riddle to her; the touch of love
had awakened the instinct to coquetry and fascination; feelings
long latent and idle were once more in activity, swaying
the woman's soul and ruling her thoughts. Judith had little
doubt of what the end would be, whether it came clandestinely,
or openly, or passed from the one to the other, as such
things often did. Still, so long as there was a chance, so long
as she had a card to play&mdash;&mdash;! She played Cousin Arthur now&mdash;for
what he was worth. After all, it was for his own good
too; he was a deeply interested party. When she saw that
he understood her efforts, though not how urgent was the need
of them, and was glad to help, her heart went out to him, and
she found a new motive for the labours she had been tempted
to abandon.</p>

<p>She got no help from Godfrey Lisle. He was sulking; no
other word is so apt to describe his attitude towards the
thing which threatened him. Though he did not know how
far matters had or had not gone, he too had seen a change in his
wife; he had watched her covertly and cautiously; he had
watched Oliver Wyse. Slowly he had been driven from
indifference into resentment and jealousy, as he recognised
Bernadette's feelings. He tried to shut his eyes to the possibility
of a crisis that would call for all the qualities which he
did not possess&mdash;courage, resolution, determination, and perhaps
also for an affection which he had lost, and an understanding
which he had never braced himself to attain. Since he
could not or dared not act, he declared that there lay on him
no obligation. He hated the idea, but it was not his. It was
Bernadette's&mdash;and hers the responsibility. He "declined to believe
it," as people say so often of a situation with which they
cannot or are afraid to grapple. He did believe it, but declining
to believe it seemed at once to justify his inaction and to
aggravate his wife's guilt. Thus it came about that he was
fighting the impending catastrophe with no better weapon
than the sulks.</p>

<p>At first the sulks had been passive; he had merely withdrawn
himself, gone into his shell, after his old fashion. But
under the influence of his grudge and his unhappiness he went
further now, not of set purpose, but with an instinctive
striving after the sympathy and support for which he longed,
and an instinctive desire to make the object of his resentment
uncomfortable. He tried to gather a party for himself, to win
the members of the household to his side, to isolate Bernadette.
This effort affected his manner towards her. It lost some of
its former courtesy, or at least his politeness was purely formal;
he became sarcastic, disagreeable, difficult over the small
questions of life which from time to time cropped up; he
would call the others to witness how unreasonable Bernadette
was, or to join him in ridiculing or depreciating her pursuits,
her tastes, or her likings. Sometimes there was an indirect
thrust at Oliver Wyse himself.</p>

<p>Being in the wrong on the main issue generally makes people
anxious to be in the right in subsidiary matters. Bernadette,
conscious of the cause of her husband's surliness, met it with
perfect good-nature&mdash;behaved really like an angel under
it, thought Judith with one of her bitterly humorous smiles.
Arthur, a stranger to the cause of the surliness&mdash;for though he
had given Oliver Wyse a thought or two on his own account,
he had given him none on Godfrey's score&mdash;was troubled at it,
and proportionately admired the angelic character of the
response. His chivalry took fire.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the old chap?" he asked Judith.
"He's downright rude to her sometimes. He never used to be
that."</p>

<p>"Something's upset him, I suppose&mdash;some little grievance.
I don't think she minds, you know."</p>

<p>"I mind, though, especially when he seems to expect me
to back him up. I'll soon show him I won't do it!"</p>

<p>"You'd much better not mix yourself up in it&mdash;whatever
it is. It won't last long, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I can't stand it if it does. I shall have it out with him.
The way Bernadette stands it is perfectly wonderful."</p>

<p>Another halo for the fair and saintly head! Judith jerked
her own head impatiently. The natural woman longed to cry
out: "Don't you see how clever the minx is?" Sometimes
the natural woman was tempted to wish that Oliver Wyse
would swoop down, carry off his prey, and end the whole
situation.</p>

<p>But there was to be a little more of it yet, a little more time
for the fascination of the new manner and the halo of imputed
saintliness to work. Oliver Wyse had interrupted his visit
by reason of the illness of an old uncle, to whom he had owed
his start in life and whom he could not neglect. It had proved
rather a long business&mdash;Bernadette read a passage from Sir
Oliver's letter to the company at breakfast&mdash;but the old man
was convalescent at last, and Sir Oliver would be able to leave
him in three or four days more, if all went well.</p>

<p>"So, if I may, I'll settle provisionally to be with you next
Friday," said the letter. It went on&mdash;and Bernadette also went
on composedly&mdash;"So there ought to be nothing in the way of
our making the motor excursion I suggested one day in the
following week, if you've a mind for it then." She folded up
the letter, laid it beside her, took a sip of coffee, and caught
Judith's eyes regarding her with what seemed like an amused
admiration. Her own glance in return was candid and simple.
"I'm afraid I forget what his excursion was to be, but it
doesn't matter."</p>

<p>"I haven't had my excursion yet," Arthur complained.
"The fact is we've done hardly anything since I came."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall have yours to-morrow, if it's fine," Bernadette
promised.</p>

<p>"For how long does Oliver Wyse propose to honour us?"
asked Godfrey, glowering and glum at the other end of the
table.</p>

<p>"I really don't exactly know. A week or so, I should think."</p>

<p>Godfrey grunted surlily. "A week too much!" the grunt
plainly said. He turned to Arthur. "Yes, you'd better get
your excursion while you can. When Wyse is here, we none
of us get much chance at the car."</p>

<p>Saintliness ignored the grumble. Arthur fidgeted under it.
"If you want the car, I'm sure I don't want to take it from
you, Godfrey," he said rather hotly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I spoke in your interest. I'm not likely to be asked
to go on a motor excursion!"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't go for the world, if you were asked," said
Judith.</p>

<p>"It'll hold us all. Anybody can come who likes," remarked
Bernadette meekly.</p>

<p>"That's a very pressing invitation, isn't it?" Godfrey
growled to Arthur, asking his sympathy.</p>

<p>Little scenes like this were frequent now, though Oliver
Wyse's name was not often dragged into them; Godfrey
shrank from doing that often, for fear of defiance and open
war. More commonly it was just a sneer at Bernadette, a
"damper" administered to her merriment. But Arthur
resented it all, and came to fear it, so that he no longer sought
his cousin's company on walks or in his study, but left him to
his own melancholy devices. The unhappy man, sensitive as
he was, saw the change in a moment and hailed a new grievance;
his own kinsman now his wife was setting against him!</p>

<p>In fact Bernadette's influence was all thrown in the other
scale. It was she who prevented Arthur from open remonstrance,
forbade him to be her champion, insisted that he
should still, to as great a degree as his feelings would allow,
be his cousin's friend and companion. She was really and
honestly sorry for Godfrey, and felt a genuine compunction
about him&mdash;though not an overwhelming one. Godfrey had
not loved her for a long while; Oliver Wyse was not responsible
for that. But she had led him to suppose that she was
content with the state of affairs between them; in fact she had
been pretty well content with it. Now she had changed&mdash;and
proposed to act accordingly. Acting accordingly would mean
not breaking his heart, but dealing a sore blow at his pride,
shattering his home, upsetting his life utterly. She really
wanted to soften the blow as much as possible; if she left
him, she wanted to leave him with friends&mdash;people he liked&mdash;about
him; with Margaret, with Judith, and with Arthur.
Then she could picture him as presently settling down comfortably
enough. Perhaps there was an alloy of self-regard in
this feeling&mdash;a salve to a conscience easily salved&mdash;but in the
main it came of the claim of habit and old partnership, and of
her natural kindliness. These carried her now beyond her
first delight in the drama of the situation; that persisted and
recurred, but she was also honestly trying to make the catastrophe
as little of a catastrophe as was possible, consistently
with the effecting of its main object. So it came about that,
in these last days before Oliver Wyse arrived, she thought
more about her husband than she had done for years before,
and treated his surliness with a most commendable patience.</p>

<p>Although Arthur's relations with Godfrey had thus suffered
a check, his friendship with little Margaret throve; the shy
child gradually allowed him an approach to intimacy. They
had rambles together, and consultations over guinea-pigs and
gardening. Here Arthur saw a chance of seconding Judith's
efforts after family unity. Here there was room, even in his
eyes&mdash;for Bernadette, though kind and affectionate in her
bearing towards the child, did not make a companion of her.
Inspired by this idea, he offered a considerable sacrifice of his
own inclination. When the day came for his motor excursion,
he proposed to Bernadette that Margaret should be of the
party. "It'll be such a tremendous treat for her to be taken
with you," he said.</p>

<p>Bernadette was surprised, amused, just a little chagrined.
In her own mind she had invested this excursion with a certain
garb of romance or of sentiment. It was to be, as she reckoned,
in all likelihood her last long <i>tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte</i> (the driver on the front
seat did not count) with Cousin Arthur; it was to be in some
sort a farewell&mdash;not to a lover indeed, but yet to a devotee.
True, the devotee was not aware of that fact, but he must
know that Oliver Wyse's arrival would entail a considerable
interruption of his opportunities for devotion. Arthur's
proposal was reassuring, of course, in regard to his feelings,
for it did not seem to her that it could come from one who was
in any danger of succumbing to a passion, and once or twice
in these later days a suspicion that the situation might develop
in that awkward fashion had made its way into her mind.
Arthur must be safe enough as to that if he were ready to
abandon his long <i>tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte</i>! She was really glad to think that
she could dismiss the suspicion. But she was also a little
disappointed over her sentimental excursion&mdash;at having it
turned into what was in effect a family party. Even talk
about sentiment would be at a discount with Margaret
there.</p>

<p>"It'll be rather a long day for her, won't it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It'll be such a great thing to her, and we can cut it a bit
shorter," he urged.</p>

<p>With a slight lift of her brows and a smile Bernadette
yielded. "Oh, all right, then!"</p>

<p>"How awfully good of you!" he cried. "How awfully
good of me!" would have seemed to her an exclamation more
appropriate in his mouth at the moment.</p>

<p>The child was sent for, to hear the great news. She came
and stood dutifully by her mother's knee, and Bernadette
put her arm round her waist.</p>

<p>"Cousin Arthur and I are going for a long drive in the car.
We shall take our lunch, and eat it by the road-side, and have
great fun. And you're to come with us, Margaret!"</p>

<p>The delighted smile which was expected (by Arthur, at
least, most confidently) to illuminate the child's solemn little
face did not make its appearance. After a momentary hesitation,
Margaret said "Yes, mummy."</p>

<p>"You like to come, don't you, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mummy." She looked down and fidgeted her toe on
the carpet. "If you wish me to."</p>

<p>"No, dear, I want to know what you wish. Were you going
to do something else?"</p>

<p>"Well, Judith had promised to take me with her to Mrs.
Beard's this morning, and show me Mrs. Beard's rabbits."</p>

<p>The tone was undeniably wistful, whether the main attraction
lay in Judith, in Mrs. Beard, or in the rabbits. The combination
was a powerful one in Margaret's eyes.</p>

<p>"And would you rather do that than come with us?"
Bernadette went on, very kindly, very gently.</p>

<p>The toe worked hard at the carpet.</p>

<p>"Do just what you like, dear. I only want you to please
yourself."</p>

<p>"If you really don't mind, mummy, I think I would
rather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very well then!" Bernadette kissed her. "Run away to
Judith!"</p>

<p>The delighted smile came at last, as Margaret looked up in
gratitude at her kind mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you so much, mummy!" And she darted off
with an unusual gleefulness.</p>

<p>Bernadette, her part of kind mother admirably played,
looked across at Arthur. He was so crestfallen that she could
not forbear from laughing. His scheme a failure, his sacrifice
thwarted! The father sulked; the child, with an innocent
but fatal sincerity, repelled advances. Things looked bad for
the unifiers! Indeed one of them had put her foot neatly
through the plan devised by the other. Judith knew about
the proposed excursion; clearly she had not thought it possible
that Margaret would be asked to join, or she would never have
arranged the visit to Mrs. Beard.</p>

<p>"We're unfortunate in meeting a strong counter-attraction,
Arthur. We've overrated the charms of our society, I'm
afraid." Though Bernadette laughed, she spoke in dry tones,
and her look was malicious.</p>

<p>Arthur felt foolish. When once the scheme was a failure,
it came to look futile, hopeless&mdash;and terribly obvious. Bernadette
saw through it, of course; her look told him that.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I suppose rabbits are&mdash;&mdash;!" he murmured
feebly.</p>

<p>"Rabbits&mdash;and Judith!" She rose and went to the window.
"I rather think it's going to rain." Then after a
pause she went on, "I think you're rather a conventionally
minded person, Arthur."</p>

<p>He attempted no defence. She had seen through the scheme&mdash;oh,
quite clearly! She was vexed too; she was frowning
now, as she stood by the window.</p>

<p>"You can't have the same tastes and&mdash;and likings as people
have just because you happen to be some relation or other to
them. It's no use trying." She gave an impatient little shake
of her head. She had not altogether liked the child's being
asked; she liked no better the child's being unwilling to come.
Little as she had wanted Margaret's company, it was not
flattering to be postponed in her regard to rabbits&mdash;and Judith.
Still, if the child did prefer rabbits and Judith&mdash;well, there was
the comforting reflection that she could always have rabbits
at a very moderate cost, and that there was no reason to
apprehend that she would be deprived of Judith. What she
valued least was the thing she was most likely to lose, as matters
stood at present. Hurt vanity wrested the little girl's
innocent sincerity into an argument for Bernadette's secret
purpose.</p>

<p>"I don't like the look of that cloud. I'm sure it's going to
rain."</p>

<p>Arthur glanced out of the window in a perfunctory way;
he felt that he would have to accept Bernadette's view of the
weather prospects, however subjective that view might be.</p>

<p>She was out of conceit with the excursion. All this "fuss"&mdash;as
she expressed it in the primitive phraseology of inward
reflection&mdash;spoilt it. She was rather out of humour even with
Cousin Arthur. She did not mind Judith planning and
scheming in the interests of family union; she was used to
that and regarded it with an amused toleration. But she did
not fancy Arthur's undertaking the same <i>rÃ´le</i>. In her conception
his proper attitude was that of a thorough-going
partisan and nothing else. As such, he had been about to
receive the tribute of that excursion. Now she was no more
inclined to it. That sort of thing depended entirely on being
in the mood for it. Arthur's&mdash;well, yes, Arthur's stupidity&mdash;and
Margaret's&mdash;well, yes, Margaret's ungraciousness&mdash;had
between them spoilt it. She felt tired of the whole thing&mdash;tired
and impatient.</p>

<p>"I think we'll wait for a safer day, Arthur."</p>

<p>"All right. Just as you like." He was hurt, but felt himself
in fault and attempted no protest; he knew that she was
displeased with him&mdash;for the first time in all their acquaintance.</p>

<p>So the car was countermanded. But the next day was no
safer, nor the day that followed. Then came Friday, which
was otherwise dedicated. Neither as a sentimental farewell
nor as a family party did that excursion ever happen.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h2>THE LAST ENTRENCHMENT</h2>


<p>On that Friday morning Arthur's seclusion&mdash;for thus
his stay at Hilsey might be described, so remote it
seemed from the rest of his life, so isolated and self-contained&mdash;was
invaded by the arrival of two letters concerned
with matters foreign to Hilsey and its problems or
emotions.</p>

<p>The first he opened was from Joe Halliday and treated of
the farce. Joe wrote with his usual optimism; prospects were
excellent; the company which had been engaged was beyond
praise. But there was a difficulty, a hitch. The producer,
Mr. Langley Etheringham, a man of authority in his line,
declared that the last act needed strengthening, and that he
knew what would strengthen it. The author, Mr. Claud
Beverley, denied that it needed strengthening and (still more
vigorously) that Mr. Etheringham knew how to do it. There
was friction. Joe was undecided between the two. "We
three are going to meet on Sunday and have a good go at it,"
he wrote. "Thrash the thing out, you know, and get at a
decision. I've got Claud to agree to so much after a lot of
jaw&mdash;authors are silly asses, sometimes, you know. Now I
want you to come up to-morrow or next day, and go through
the piece with me, and then come on Sunday too. You'll
bring a fresh mind to it that will, I think, be valuable&mdash;I seem
to know it so well that I really can't judge it&mdash;and you've put
in so much of the money that both Claud and Langley (though
he's a despotic sort of gent) will be bound to listen to your
opinion, whatever it is. Come if you can, old chap. I've no
doubt of success anyhow, but this is rather important. Above
all, we don't want Claud and Langley at loggerheads even
before we begin rehearsals."</p>

<p>Frowning thoughtfully, Arthur proceeded to read the second
letter. It came from Henry. "I beg to inform you that
Messrs. Wills and Mayne rang up at two o'clock to-day to
ask if you were in town. I had to say that you had been called
away on business but could be here to-morrow (in accordance
with your instructions). They replied that they regretted
the matter could not wait. I did not therefore wire you, but
I think it proper to inform you of the matter. Yours
obediently&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Appeal from Joe Halliday, plain though tacit reproach from
Henry! A chance lost at the Temple! How big a chance
there was no telling; there never is in such cases. A cry for
help from the Syndicate! His legitimate mistress the Law
was revenging herself for his neglect; Drama, the nymph of
his errant fancy, whom he had wooed at the risk of a thousand
pounds (or indeed, if a true psychology be brought to bear on
the transaction, of fifteen hundred), might do the like unless
he hastened to her side.</p>

<p>Pangs of self-reproach assailed Arthur as he sat on the
lawn, smoking his pipe. Moreover he was not in such perfect
good humour with Hilsey as he was wont to be. The miscarriage
of his excursion rankled in his mind; the perfection
of his harmony with Bernadette was a trifle impaired; there
had been a touch of aloofness in her manner the last two days.
Godfrey was too grumpy for words. Finally, to-day Oliver
Wyse was coming. Was Hilsey really so fascinating that for
its <i>beaux yeux</i> a man must risk his interests, neglect his profession,
and endanger, even by the difference of a hair, a
dramatic success which was to outvie the triumph of <i>Help
Me Out Quickly</i>? Yet he was annoyed at having to put this
question to himself, at having to ask himself how he stood
towards Hilsey and how Hilsey stood to him. And, down
in his heart, he knew that it would be very difficult to
go if Bernadette really wanted him to stay&mdash;and a very
distressful departure for him if it appeared that she did
not!</p>

<p>Judith came out of the house, crossed the lawn, and sat
down in a chair opposite him. They had met earlier in the
day, and greeting did not seem necessary to Arthur's preoccupied
mind. He was smoking rather hard, and still frowning
over his problem. Judith, on the other hand, seemed to be
engaged with some secret source of amusement, although
amusement of a rather sardonic order. Her mouth was twisted
in a satirical smile&mdash;not at Arthur's expense, but at the expense
of some person or persons unknown.</p>

<p>Arthur did not notice her expression, but presently he
announced to her the outcome of his thoughts.</p>

<p>"I think I shall have to go back to town to-morrow for a
bit; some business has turned up."</p>

<p>Her eyes met his quickly and, somehow, rather suspiciously.
"Oh, don't you run away too!" she said.</p>

<p>"Run away too! What do you mean? Who's running
away? What are you grinning at, Judith?" The word,
though not complimentary, really described the character of
her smile.</p>

<p>"Godfrey's gone to bed."</p>

<p>"Gone to bed? Why, he was at breakfast!"</p>

<p>"I know. But he says he got up feeling seedy, and now he
feels worse. So he's gone to bed."</p>

<p>Arthur looked hard at her, and gradually smiled himself.
"What's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"He says he's got a bad liver attack. But I&mdash;I think he's
left out the first letter."</p>

<p>"Left out&mdash;&mdash;? Oh, no, you don't mean&mdash;&mdash;?" He burst
out laughing. "Well, I'm jiggered!"</p>

<p>"Oliveritis&mdash;that's my diagnosis. He does go to bed sometimes,
you know, when&mdash;well, when the world gets too hard
for him, poor Godfrey!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I never heard of such a thing! It can't be that!
Does he hate him as much as that?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't like him."</p>

<p>"Do you think that's why he's been so grumpy lately?"</p>

<p>"I suppose he'd say that was the liver attack coming on,
but&mdash;well, I've told you!"</p>

<p>"But to go to bed!" Arthur chuckled again. "Well, I
am jiggered!"</p>

<p>"You may be jiggered as much as you like&mdash;but must you
go to London?"</p>

<p>"Does Bernadette know he's gone to bed?" Pursuing
his own train of amused wonder, Arthur did not mark Judith's
question, with its note of appeal.</p>

<p>"I told Barber to tell her. I didn't think I should look
grave enough&mdash;or perhaps Bernadette either!"</p>

<p>"Why, would she tumble to its being&mdash;Oliveritis?"</p>

<p>"She'd have her suspicions, I think. I asked you just now
whether you really must go to London, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to&mdash;though I've a slight touch of that
disease of Godfrey's myself&mdash;but I suppose I ought. It's like
this." He told her of the lost chance at chambers, and of
Joe Halliday's summons. "It's no use going to-day," he
ended, "but I expect I ought to go to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, I expect you ought," she agreed gravely. "You
mustn't miss chances because of&mdash;because of us down here."</p>

<p>"It isn't obvious that I'm any particular sort of use down
here, is it?"</p>

<p>"You're of use to me anyhow, Arthur."</p>

<p>"To you?" He was evidently surprised at this aspect of
the case.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you weren't thinking of me, were you? However,
you are. Things aren't always easy here, as you may
have observed, and it's a great comfort to have someone to
help&mdash;someone to grumble to or&mdash;or to share a smile with,
you know."</p>

<p>"That's very nice of you. You know I've always supposed
you thought me rather an ass."</p>

<p>"Oh, in some ways, yes, of course you are!" She laughed,
but not at all unpleasantly. "I should have liked to have
you here through&mdash;well, through Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"The chap's a bit of a nuisance, isn't he? Well, I needn't
make up my mind till to-morrow. It's no use going to-day,
and to-morrow's Saturday. So Sunday for the piece, and
chambers on Monday! That'd be all right&mdash;especially as
I've probably lost my only chance. I'll wait till to-morrow,
and see how Sir Oliver shapes!" He ended with a laugh as
his mind went back to Godfrey. "Gone to bed, poor old
chap!"</p>

<p>Judith joined again in his laugh. Godfrey's course of action
struck on their humour as the culmination, the supreme
expression, of his attitude towards the world and its troubles.
He could not fight them in the open; he took refuge from
them within his fortifications. If they laid siege and the
attack pressed hotly, he retreated from the outer to the inner
defences. What the philosopher found in a mind free from
passions&mdash;a citadel than which a man has nothing more
secure whereto he can fly for refuge and there be inexpugnable&mdash;Godfrey
Lisle found in a more material form. He found
it in Bed!</p>

<p>But when Arthur went up to see his cousin, his amusement
gave place, in some measure, to sympathy. Pity for his forlornness
asserted itself. Godfrey insisted that he was ill;
he detailed physical symptoms; he assumed a bravado
about "sticking it out" till to-morrow, and not having the
doctor till then, about "making an effort" to get up to-morrow.
Through it all ran a suspicion that he was himself
suspected. Bernadette was in the room part of the time.
She too was sympathetic, very kind, and apparently without
any suspicion. True that she did not look at Arthur much,
but that might have been accidental, or the result of her care
for her husband. If it were a sign that she could not trust
herself in confidential glances, it was the only indication she
gave of scepticism as to the liver attack.</p>

<p>At lunch-time too her admirable bearing and the presence
of Margaret enforced gravity and a sympathetic attitude,
though out of the patient's hearing it was possible to treat
his condition with less seriousness.</p>

<p>"He's fanciful about himself sometimes," said Bernadette.
"It's nerves partly, I expect. We must cheer him up all we
can. Margaret can go and sit with him presently, and you
might go up again later, Arthur. He likes to talk to you,
you know. And"&mdash;She smiled&mdash;"if Godfrey's laid up, you'll
have to help me with Sir Oliver. You must be host, if he
can't."</p>

<p>Bernadette had not practised any of her new graces on
Arthur since the miscarriage of the excursion; either the
check to her sentiment, the little wound to her vanity, prevented
her, or else she had grown too engrossed in the near
prospect of Oliver Wyse's arrival. At all events the new
manner had been in abeyance. She had been her old self,
with her old unmeditated charm; it had lost nothing by
being just a little pensive&mdash;not low-spirited, but thoughtful
and gentle. She had borne herself thus towards all of them.
She showed no uneasiness, no fear of being watched. She
was quite simple and natural. Nor did she pretend any
exaggerated indifference about Oliver. She accepted the
fact that he came as her particular friend and that she was
glad of his coming in that capacity. They all knew about that,
of course, just as they knew that Cousin Arthur was her
devotee. All simple and natural&mdash;when Oliver Wyse was not
there. Arthur, who had not been at Hilsey during Sir Oliver's
first visit, was still in the dark. Judith Arden had her certainty,
gained from the observation of the two in the course
of it&mdash;and Godfrey his gnawing suspicion.</p>

<p>For Bernadette, absorbed, fascinated, excited, had been a
little off her guard then&mdash;and Oliver Wyse had not taken
enough pains to be on his. He was not clever at the concealment
and trickery which he so much disliked. His contempt
for Godfrey Lisle made him refuse to credit him with either
the feelings or the vigilance of a husband. He had not troubled
his head much about Judith, not caring greatly whether she
suspected what he felt or not; what could she do or say
about it? As his power over Bernadette increased, as his
assurance of victory had grown, so had the signs of them&mdash;those
signs which had given Judith certainty, and the remembrance
of which now drove Godfrey to that last citadel of his.
But to Bernadette herself they had seemed small, perceptible
indeed and welcome to her private eye, but so subtle, so
minute&mdash;as mere signs are apt to seem to people who have
beheld the fulness of the thing signified. She did not know
herself betrayed, either by her own doing or by his.</p>

<p>Oliver Wyse was expected to arrive about tea-time; he
was bringing his own car, as Bernadette had announced that
morning at breakfast, not without a meaning glance at
Godfrey&mdash;nobody need grudgingly give up the car to him
this time! It was about four when Arthur again visited the
invalid. He found Margaret with her father; they were both
reading books, for Margaret could spell her way through a
fairy-story by now, and they seemed happy and peaceful.
When Arthur came in, Godfrey laid down his book readily,
and received him with something more like his old welcome.
In reply to enquiries he admitted that he felt rather better,
but added that he meant to take no risks. "Tricky things,
these liver attacks!" Arthur received the impression that
he would think twice and thrice before he emerged from his
refuge. He looked yellowish&mdash;very likely he had fretted himself
into some little ailment&mdash;but there was about him an air
of relief, almost of resignation. "At all events I needn't see
the man when he comes"&mdash;so Arthur imagined Godfrey's
inner feelings and smiled within himself at such weakness, at
the mixture of timidity and bearishness which turned an unwelcome
arrival into a real calamity, a thing to be feared and
dodged. But there it was&mdash;old Godfrey's way, his idiosyncrasy;
he was a good old fellow really, and one must make
the best of it.</p>

<p>So for this hour the three were harmonious and content
together. Timid yet eager questions from Margaret about
fairies and giants and their varying ways, about rabbits and
guinea-pigs and sundry diversities in their habits; from
Godfrey a pride and interest in his little daughter which
Arthur's easy friendship with her made him less shy of displaying;
Arthur's own ready and generous pleasure in encountering
no more grumpiness&mdash;all these things combined
to make the hour pleasant. It was almost possible to forget
Oliver Wyse.</p>

<p>But presently Margaret's attendant came to fetch her;
she was to have her tea rather early and then change her
frock&mdash;in order to go downstairs and see Sir Oliver; such
were mother's orders. Godfrey's face relapsed into peevishness
even while the little girl was kissing him good-bye.</p>

<p>"Why should she be dragged down to see Wyse?" he
demanded when she was gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose it's the usual thing. Their mothers like
showing them off."</p>

<p>"All damned nonsense!" grumbled Godfrey, and took up
his book again. But he did not read it. He looked at his
watch on the table by him. "Half-past four! He'll be here
directly."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, old chap, does it matter so much&mdash;&mdash;?" Arthur
had begun, when Godfrey raised himself in his bed and held
up his hand.</p>

<p>"There's a motor-horn!" he said. "Listen, don't you
hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose it's him." He strolled to the window,
which looked on the drive. "There is a car coming; I suppose
it's his."</p>

<p>Godfrey let his hand drop, but sat upright for a few moments
longer, listening. The car passed the window and stopped at
the door.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's Wyse all right. The car's open. I saw him."
So saying, Arthur left the window and sauntered back towards
the bed, his face adorned with a well-meaning smile of common
sense and consolation. But Godfrey lay down on the pillow
again, and with an inarticulate grunt turned his face to the
wall. Arthur stood looking at him in amazement. His smile
grew grim&mdash;what a ridiculous old chap it was!</p>

<p>But there was no more to be got out of him just now; that
was clear enough. No more welcome, no more friendly talk!
The sulks were back again in full force; Godfrey was entrenched
in his last citadel. On Arthur himself devolved the
function of acting as Sir Oliver's host. Feeling no great desire
to discharge his duties, he lounged slowly down the stairs into
the hall; he was conscious of a distinct touch of Oliveritis.</p>

<p>The door which led from the hall to Bernadette's own room
stood open. They were standing together by the window,
Bernadette with her back towards Arthur. Wyse faced her,
and her hand rested lightly on his arm&mdash;just as it had so often
rested on Arthur's own, in the little trick of friendly caress
that she had. He ought to have known just what&mdash;just how
much&mdash;could properly be inferred from it; none the less he
frowned to see it now. Then he noticed Oliver Wyse's face,
rising over her head&mdash;for Oliver was tall&mdash;and turned downwards
towards her. Arthur was in flannels and wore rubber
shoes; his feet had made no sound on the carpeted stairs.
His approach was unnoticed.</p>

<p>The next minute he was crossing the hall with determined,
emphatic, highly audible steps. Slowly, as it seemed, Oliver
Wyse raised his head, and slowly a smile came to his lips as he
looked over Bernadette's head at the young man. Then she
turned round&mdash;very quickly. She was smiling, and her eyes
were bright. But something in Arthur's face attracted her
attention. She flushed a little. Her voice was louder than
usual, and seemed as it were hurried, when she said:</p>

<p>"Here's Sir Oliver safe and sound, Arthur! He's done it
in two hours and twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"Not bad going, was it?" asked Oliver, still looking at
Arthur with that cool, self-confident, urbane smile. He was
not embarrassed; rather it seemed as though he were defying
the intruder to embarrass him, whatever he might have seen,
whatever he might be pleased to think.</p>

<p>But Bernadette, his adored, his hopelessly idealised Bernadette&mdash;ah,
the vulgar, the contaminating suspicion!&mdash;Bernadette
was looking as if she had been caught! A sudden
swift current of feeling ran through him&mdash;a new feeling which
made his blood hot with resentment of that confident smile.</p>

<p>Bernadette's confusion was but momentary. She was quite
herself again, serene and at ease, as she said, "Will you show
him his room? He'd like a wash before tea. He's in the
Red Room&mdash;over the porch, you know."</p>

<p>Arthur entered on his duties as deputy-host to the urbane
and smiling guest.</p>

<h2>A PRUDENT COUNSELLOR</h2>


<p>Arthur escaped from the house as soon as he could,
leaving Bernadette and Sir Oliver at tea together.
He could not bear to be with them; he had need to
be alone with his anger and bewilderment. Perhaps if he
were alone for a bit he could see things better, get them in a
true perspective, and make up his mind whether he was being
a fool now or had been a fool&mdash;a sore fool&mdash;up to now. Which
was the truth? Bernadette's confusion, if real at all, had been
momentary; Sir Oliver's cool confidence had never wavered.
He did not know what to think.</p>

<p>All its old peace and charm enveloped Hilsey that summer
evening, but they could not calm the ferment of his spirit.
There was war within him; the new idea clashed so terribly
with all the old ones. The image of Bernadette which he had
fashioned and set up rocked on its pedestal. A substitute
began to form itself in his consciousness, not less fascinating&mdash;alas,
no!&mdash;but very different. He could not turn his eyes
from it now; it filled him with fear and anger.</p>

<p>He crossed the bridge and the meadows beyond it, making
for the wood which crowned the hill above, walking quickly,
under an impulse of restlessness, a desire to get away&mdash;though,
again, the next instant he would be seized with a mad idea of
going straight back and "having it out" with her, with
Oliver&mdash;with somebody! Shaking it off, he would stride
forward again, his whole mind enmeshed in pained perplexity.
Oh, to know the truth! And yet the truth might be fearful,
shattering.</p>

<p>The bark of a dog, short and sharp, struck on his ears. Then,
"Patsy, Patsy, come here!" and a laugh. Judith was sitting
on the trunk of a tree newly cut down, by the side of the path.
She had a book in her lap; Patsy had been on guard beside
her.</p>

<p>"Where are you rushing to at six miles an hour?" she
asked. "You frightened Patsy."</p>

<p>He stopped in front of her. "Was I walking quickly? I&mdash;I'm
not going anywhere in particular&mdash;just for a stroll before
dinner."</p>

<p>"A stroll!" She laughed again, raising her brows. "Sit
down for a bit, and then we'll walk back together. You look
quite hot."</p>

<p>He sat down by her and lit a cigarette. But he did not
meet her eyes. He sat staring straight before him with a
frowning face, as he smoked. She made her inspection of him,
unperceived herself, but she let him know the result of it.
"You look rather gloomy, Arthur. Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;Well, except that Oliver Wyse has got here&mdash;about
an hour ago, before tea."</p>

<p>"Sir Oliver is much as usual, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I don't know him very well, you see."</p>

<p>"Meeting him doesn't seem to have had a very cheering
effect upon you. You look about as jolly as Hamlet."</p>

<p>He shook his head impatiently, but made no answer. He
did look very forlorn. She patted his shoulder. "Oh, come,
cheer up! Whatever it is, grouching won't help. We mustn't
have you going to bed too, like Godfrey." She gave him this
lead, hoping that he would take it. It seemed better to her
now that he should realise the truth, or some of it.</p>

<p>He turned his face towards her slowly. She looked at him
with grave eyes, but with a little smile&mdash;of protest, as it were,
against any overdoing of the tragedy.</p>

<p>"What does the fellow want here?" he asked in a very
low voice.</p>

<p>"All he can get," she answered brusquely. "That's my
opinion anyhow, though I couldn't prove it."</p>

<p>He did not move; he looked at her still; his eyes were
heavy with another question. But he dared not put it&mdash;at
least not yet. "Why is he allowed to come here then?"
he grumbled.</p>

<p>"Who's to stop him? Godfrey? From bed?"</p>

<p>The remembrance of Godfrey turning his face to the wall
answered her question. But she went on with a repressed
vehemence, "Do you suppose Godfrey needs telling? Well,
then, what could I do? And I'm not sure I'd do anything if
I could. I've done my best with this family, but it's pretty
hopeless. Things must happen as they must, Arthur. And
you've no right to hold me responsible."</p>

<p>"I can't understand it," he muttered slowly.</p>

<p>"I thought you would by now&mdash;staying in the house."</p>

<p>"But she'd never&mdash;let him?" His voice sank to a whisper.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Women do, you know. Why not Bernadette?"</p>

<p>"But she's not like that, not that sort," he broke out,
suddenly angry again.</p>

<p>She turned rather hard and contemptuous. "Not that sort?
She's a woman, isn't she? She's never been like that with
you&mdash;that's what you really mean."</p>

<p>"It isn't," he declared passionately. "I've never&mdash;never
had so much as a thought of anything like that."</p>

<p>"I know. You've made something superhuman of her.
Well, Sir Oliver hasn't."</p>

<p>"I won't believe it of her!"</p>

<p>The burden of grief and desolation in his voice made Judith
gentle and tender again. "Oh, I know you won't, my dear,"
she said, "unless you absolutely have to, absolutely must."
She got up and whistled to recall her dog, which had strayed
into the wood. "I must go back, or I shall be late for dinner.
Are you coming, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's plenty of time. I must think what to do."</p>

<p>She turned away with a shrug of her shoulders. What
could he do? What could anybody? Things must happen as
they would&mdash;for good or evil as they would.</p>

<p>Things were likely to happen now, and that quickly. At the
very moment when Arthur came upon them in Bernadette's
room, Oliver had been telling her of his completed plan. The
yacht would be round to Southampton by the following Tuesday.
They would motor over&mdash;it was within a drive of
moderate length from Hilsey&mdash;go on board, and set sail over
summer seas. She had turned from that vision to meet
Arthur's startled eyes; hence her momentary confusion. But
she was over it now. While they drank their tea, Oliver well-nigh
persuaded her that it had never existed&mdash;never, at least,
been visible. And besides, "What does it matter what he
thinks?" Oliver urged.</p>

<p>To this Bernadette would not quite agree. "I don't want
him to&mdash;to have any idea of it till&mdash;till the time comes," she
said fretfully. "I don't want anybody to have any idea till
then&mdash;least of all Arthur."</p>

<p>"Well, it's not for long, and we'll be very careful," he said
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, you promised me that when I let you come back
here," she reminded him eagerly.</p>

<p>"I know. I'll keep my word." He looked into her eyes
as he repeated, "It's not for long."</p>

<p>If Oliver Wyse had not inspired her with a great passion&mdash;a
thing that no man perhaps could create from what there was
to work on in her soul&mdash;he had achieved an almost complete
domination over her. He had made his standards hers, his
judgments the rule and measure of her actions and thoughts.
She saw through his eyes, and gave to things and people much
the dimensions that he did, the importance or the unimportance.
At his bidding she turned her back on her old life and
looked forward&mdash;forward only. But to one thing she clung
tenaciously. She had made up her mind to the crash and
upheaval at Hilsey, but she had no idea of its happening while
she was there; she meant to give&mdash;to risk giving&mdash;no occasion
for that. Her ears should not hear nor her eyes see the fall
of the structure. No sight of it, scarcely a rumbling echo, need
reach her as she sailed the summer seas. Oliver himself had
insisted on the great plunge, the great break; so much benefit
she was entitled to get out of it.</p>

<p>"And be specially careful about Arthur," she urged. "Not
even the slightest risk another time!"</p>

<p>"Confound Arthur!" he laughed good-humouredly. "Why
does that boy matter so much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he thinks such a lot of me, you know. And I am very
fond of him. We've been awfully good friends, Oliver. At
all events he does appreciate me." This was why she felt
tender about Arthur, and was more sorry for him than for the
others who were to suffer by what she did. She had not been
enough to the others&mdash;neither to her husband nor to Margaret&mdash;but
to Arthur she knew that she had been and was a great
deal. Besides she could not possibly get up any case against
Arthur, whatever plausible complaints she might have about
the others, on the score of coldness, or indifference, or incompatibility,
or sulks.</p>

<p>"In Arthur's presence I'll be as prim as a monk," Oliver
promised her, laughing again, as she left him before dinner.</p>

<p>He strolled out on to the lawn, to smoke a cigarette before
going to dress, and there met Judith Arden on her return from
the wood.</p>

<p>"So you're back again, Sir Oliver!" she said, shaking
hands.</p>

<p>"As you see. I hope you're not tired of me? It's only to
be a short stay, anyhow."</p>

<p>The two were on a well-established footing, chosen by
Judith, acquiesced in by Sir Oliver. He was pretty sure that
she knew what he was about, but thought she could cause him
no hindrance, even if she wished. She treated him with a
cool irony that practically endorsed his opinion on both
points.</p>

<p>"If you're anxious to be told that we're all glad to see you,
I'll give you the formal assurance. I'm sorry my uncle is not
well enough to welcome you himself."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope he'll be up and about to-morrow. Bernadette
tells me it's nothing serious."</p>

<p>"She ought to know, Sir Oliver, being his wife."</p>

<p>"The party has received an addition since I was here, I
see."</p>

<p>"Yes. Some company for us when you and Bernadette go
out motoring!"</p>

<p>"Do you think that the addition will be willing to fall in
with that&mdash;well, that grouping?"</p>

<p>"Now I come to think of it, perhaps not. But there&mdash;you
always get your own way, don't you?"</p>

<p>"If that flattery were only sincere, it would be sweet to my
ears, Miss Judith."</p>

<p>"It's sincere enough. I didn't mean it as flattery. I spoke
rather in a spirit of resignation."</p>

<p>"The same spirit will animate our friend perhaps&mdash;the
addition, I mean."</p>

<p>"It may; it's rather in the air at Hilsey. But he mayn't
have been here long enough to catch it. I rather think he
hasn't."</p>

<p>"You invest the position with exciting possibilities!
Unless I fight hard, I may be done out of my motor
rides!"</p>

<p>"That would leave me calm," she flung at him over her
shoulder as she went into the house.</p>

<p>He walked up and down a little longer, smiling to himself,
well content. The prospect of the summer seas was before
his eyes too. He had counted the cost of the voyage, and set
it down at six months' decorous retirement&mdash;enough to let
people who felt that they must be shocked be shocked at
sufficient leisure. After that, he had no fear of not being able
to take his place in the world again. Nor need Bernadette
fear any extreme cold-shouldering from her friends. It was a
case in which everybody would be ready to make excuses, to
find the thing more or less pardonable. Why, one had only
to tell the story of how, on the eve of the crisis, the threatened
husband took to his bed!</p>

<p>As Arthur watched Bernadette at dinner, serene, gracious,
and affectionate&mdash;wary too by reason of that tiny slip&mdash;his
suspicions seemed to his reason again incredible. Judith must
be wrong, and he himself wrong also. And her friend Sir
Oliver&mdash;so composed, so urbane, so full of interesting talk
about odd parts of the world that he had seen and the strange
things which had befallen him! Surely people who were doing
or contemplating what they were suspected of could not
behave like that? That must be beyond human nature? He
and Judith must be wrong! But there was something within
him which refused the comforting conclusion. Not the old
adoration which could see no flaw in her and endure no slur on
her perfection. His adoration was eager for the conclusion,
and pressed him towards it with all the force of habit and
preconception. It was that other, that new, current of feeling
which had rushed through him when he stood in the hall and
saw them framed, as it were, by the doorway of her room&mdash;a
picture of lovers, whispered the new feeling, sparing his
recollection no detail of pose or air or look. And lovers are
very cunning, urged the new feeling, that compound of anger
and fear&mdash;the fear of another's taking what a man's desire
claims for himself. He had honestly protested to Judith that
his adoration had been honest, pure, and without self-regard.
So it had, while no one shared or threatened it. But now&mdash;how
much of his anger, how much of his fear, came from loyalty to
Godfrey, sorrow for Margaret, sorrow for Bernadette herself,
grief for his own broken idol if this thing were true? These
were good reasons and motives for fear and anger; orthodox
and sound enough. But they had not the quality of what he
felt&mdash;the heat, the glow, the intense sense of rivalry which now
possessed him, the piercing vigilance with which he watched
their every word and look and gesture. These other reasons
and motives but served to aid&mdash;really was it more than to
mask?&mdash;the change, the transmutation, that had set in at
such a pace. Under the threat of rivalry, the generous impulse
to protect became hatred of another's mastery, devotion
took on the heat of passion, and jealousy lent the vision of its
hundred eyes.</p>

<p>But Bernadette too was watchful and wary; her position
gave her an added quickness of perception. Oliver's contemptuous
self-confidence might notice nothing, but, as she
watched the other two, the effect of his persuasions wore off;
she became vaguely sensible of an atmosphere of suspicion
around her. She felt herself under observation, curious and
intense from Arthur, from Judith half-scornful, half-amused.
And Judith seemed to keep an eye on Arthur too&mdash;rather as
if she were expecting, or fearing, or waiting for something
from him. Bernadette grew impatient and weary under this
sense of scrutiny. Surely it was something new in Arthur?
And was not Judith in some way privy to it?</p>

<p>"What are the plans for to-morrow?" asked Sir Oliver, as
he sipped his glass of port. "Can we go motoring? I've
brought my car, you know, in case yours is wanted."</p>

<p>"Well, we might take them both, and all go somewhere&mdash;Margaret
too!" A family party seemed now an excellently
prudent and unsuspicious thing. "Oh, but I forgot, there's
a great cricket-match&mdash;Hilsey against Marling! I ought to
put in an appearance sometime, and I expect you're wanted
to play, aren't you, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"I believe I did tell Beard I'd play if I was wanted. I'd
forgotten about it."</p>

<p>"Have you made up your mind about going to London
to-morrow?" asked Judith.</p>

<p>Bernadette pricked up her ears&mdash;in pure metaphor, though;
she was too alert to let any outward sign of interest appear.
Yet it now seemed to her very desirable that Arthur should go
to London&mdash;for a few days anyhow. The quick look of surprise
with which he met Judith's question did nothing to lessen
this feeling.</p>

<p>He had forgotten all about going to London next day! The
plight of the farce, the possible briefs&mdash;Joe Halliday's appeal,
and the renewed enquiry from Wills and Mayne, so flattering
to professional hopes&mdash;where were they? Where are the
snows of yester year? They had gone clean out of his head,
out of his life again. They had become unimportant, irrelevant.
Again, for the moment, Hilsey closed around him on
every side.</p>

<p>He did not answer Judith for a moment. "You know you
told me you thought you might have to," she said, "for a
little while anyhow, on some business."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I know. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What business, Arthur?" Bernadette asked. "Briefs?
How exciting!"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing in particular!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I want to hear. I'm interested. I want to
know all about it."</p>

<p>He could not tell her with his old pleasure, his old delight
at any interest she might be gracious enough to shew in his
affairs; but neither could he refuse to tell. That would be
a bit of useless sulking&mdash;after Godfrey's fashion. Besides,
perhaps they were wrong&mdash;he and Judith. So he told her
about Wills and Mayne's flattering if abortive enquiry, and
how Mr. Claud Beverley and Mr. Langley Etheringham were
at loggerheads over the farce. Sir Oliver, now at his cigar,
listened benevolently. Bernadette fastened on the latter topic;
it interested her more&mdash;she thought it probably interested
Arthur more also. "That really is rather important, now!
It's sort of referred to you, to your decision, isn't it? And
it's awfully important, isn't it, Sir Oliver? Perhaps you
don't know, though&mdash;Arthur's put a lot of money in the piece."</p>

<p>"Then I certainly think he'd better run up and look after
it," smiled Sir Oliver. "I should."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall go. I expect the thing can wait;
things generally can."</p>

<p>"I don't think you're being very wise, Cousin Arthur,"
Bernadette said gently. "We shall be sorry to lose you, but
if it's only for a little while, and Mr. Halliday makes such a
point of it&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Joe always exaggerates things."</p>

<p>"I like having you here&mdash;well, I needn't tell you that&mdash;but
not if I have to feel that we're interfering with your work
or your prospects."</p>

<p>Here Jealousy had a private word for Arthur's ear. "That
sounds well, very nice and proper! But rather a new solicitude,
isn't it? Much she used to care about your work!"</p>

<p>"After all, what do I know about the third acts of farces?"</p>

<p>"I expect that's just why they want you&mdash;in a way.
You'll be like one of the public. They want to know how it
strikes one of the public. Don't you think that's it, Sir
Oliver?"</p>

<p>Sir Oliver thought so&mdash;but Jealousy was mean enough to
suggest that the lady was more ingenious than convincing.</p>

<p>"Don't you think he ought to go, Judith?"</p>

<p>The ironic comedy of this conversation (started too by
herself, in all innocence, purely <i>Ã  propos</i> of the village cricket-match!)
between the prudent counsellor and the idle apprentice
was entirely to Judith's humour. They argued their false
point so plausibly. The farce had been a great thing to him,
and would be again, it was to be hoped. And to Bernadette,
for his sake, it had been "exciting" and possibly&mdash;just
possibly&mdash;would be again. But it was not the fate of the
farce that concerned either of them now. They could not
humbug her in that fashion! Her smile was mocking as she
answered: "Yes, I think he'd better go, Bernadette. I'm
sure you're advising him for his own good."</p>

<p>Bernadette gave her a quick glance, bit her lip, and rose
from the table. "We'll have coffee in the drawing-room.
Bring your cigar, Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>Sir Oliver was smiling too; that girl Judith amused him;
he appreciated the dexterous little stabs of her two-edged
dagger.</p>

<p>But Arthur was listening to another whisper in his ear:
"Very anxious to get you away, isn't she? Curiously
anxious!"</p>

<p>When Bernadette gave him his cup of coffee she said in a
low voice, "Don't be foolish, Arthur. I really think you
ought to go."</p>

<p>He looked her full in the eyes and answered, "I see you
want me to, at all events."</p>

<p>Those whispers in his ear had done their work. He turned
abruptly away from her, not seeing the sudden fear in her
eyes. His voice had been full of passionate resentment.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2>IDOL AND DEVOTEE</h2>


<p>After drinking his coffee quickly&mdash;with no word to
anyone the while&mdash;Arthur had gone out of the
room. Judith took up her book, Oliver Wyse was
glancing at the City article in a weekly paper, Bernadette sat
quiet in her high-backed arm-chair, looking very slight and
young in her white evening frock, but wearing a tired and
fretful expression. Just what she had planned to avoid, just
what she hated, was happening or threatening to happen.
She felt herself in an atmosphere of suspicion; she was confronted
by accusers; she was made to witness her handiwork;
the sight and the sound of the shattered edifice
menaced her eyes and ears.</p>

<p>Glancing at her over his paper, Oliver saw that she was
moody. He came and tried to draw her into talk. She
received him coldly, almost peevishly. He had the tact not
to press his company on her. "I think, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go and polish off some letters. Then I shall be quite free
for to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, do, of course," she answered with what seemed
relief. She was angry now with him for having come back to
Hilsey, and with herself for having let him. "Will you go
to the library?"</p>

<p>"You've given me such a delightfully comfortable room
that I'll write there, I think."</p>

<p>"As you like, and&mdash;I'm very tired&mdash;perhaps we'd better
say good-night."</p>

<p>He smiled and pressed her hand gently. "Very well,
good-night." She gave him a glance half-penitent for her
crossness, but let him go without more. Judith accorded
him a curt 'Good-night,' without raising her head from her
book. She was reading with wonderful industry; absorbed
in the book! Bernadette interpreted this as a sign of disapproval&mdash;it
was more probably a demonstration of non-responsibility
for the ways of fate&mdash;but it was not Judith's
disapproval that particularly engaged her thoughts. They
were obstinately set on Arthur. How and what&mdash;how much&mdash;had
he found out? Enough to make him resolved not to
go to London, anyhow, it seemed! Enough to make him
spring with swift suspicion to the conclusion that she wanted
him to go for her own purposes! And yet she had been wary&mdash;and
quite plausibly sage and prudent in her counsel.</p>

<p>"Where's Arthur?" she asked. "He's disappeared!"</p>

<p>"I don't know where he is," answered Judith from behind
her book.</p>

<p>But he was more than suspicious. He was very angry.
His last brusque speech showed that, and still more the note
in his voice, a note which she had never heard before. It was
of more than indignation; it was of outrage. She could
manage the others. Margaret presented no difficulty, the
sulky helpless husband hardly more; from Judith there was
to be feared nothing worse than satiric stabs. But if Arthur
were going to be like this, the next three days would be very
difficult&mdash;and horribly distasteful. He had touched her as
well as alarmed her. Such an end to her affectionate intimacy
with him was a worse wound than she had reckoned on its
being. To see him angry with her hurt her; she had never
meant to see it, and she was not prepared for the intensity
of feeling which had found vent in his voice. It had been as
bad as a blow, that speech of his; while showing him sore
stricken, it had meant to strike her also. She had never
thought that he would want to do that. Tender regrets,
propitiating memories, an excusing and attenuating fondness&mdash;these
were what she desired to be able to attribute to Arthur
when she was sailing on the summer seas.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's become of him! Do you think he's
gone out, Judith?"</p>

<p>At last Judith closed her book and raised her head. "Why
do you want Arthur now?"</p>

<p>"I only wondered what could have become of him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's gone to pack&mdash;ready for to-morrow, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! Barber would pack for him, of course&mdash;if
he's going."</p>

<p>Judith, book in hand, rose from her chair. "I think I
shall go to bed." She came across the room to where
Bernadette sat. "You'd better too. You look tired."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not sleepy. I'm sure I couldn't sleep."</p>

<p>Judith bent down and kissed her lightly on the cheek.
"Never mind Arthur. You'd better let him alone to-night."</p>

<p>Bernadette longed to ask "What have you said to him?"
But she would not; she shrank from bringing the matter into
the open like that. It would mean a scene, she thought, and
scenes she was steadfastly purposed to avoid&mdash;if possible.</p>

<p>"Well, he's behaving rather queerly, going on like this,"
she murmured peevishly.</p>

<p>For an instant Judith stood looking at her with a smile in
which pity and derision seemed oddly mingled; then she
turned on her heel and went out.</p>

<p>Bernadette sat on alone in the big drawing-room; it was
very silent and solitary. The chill fancies of night and loneliness
assailed her. Surely nobody would do anything foolish
because of&mdash;well, because of what she did? She rejected the
idea as absurd. But she felt uncomfortable and desolate.
She might send for Sir Oliver; no doubt he was at his letters
still, and it was not really late. Yet somehow she did not
want him; she was not in the mood. Her mind was obstinate
still, and still asked obstinately of Arthur.</p>

<p>At last she got up, went through the hall, and out on to
the terrace. She looked up and down the length of it. The
night was fine and the moon shone, but she saw no sign of
him. She called his name softly; there was no reply. Either
he had gone further afield, or he was in the house. She
paused a moment, and then took her way along the corridor
which led past the dining-room to the smoking-room&mdash;an
apartment seldom used in these lax days (when every room
is a smoking-room) and rather remote. Perhaps he had
retreated there. She stood for a moment outside the door,
hesitating at the last whether to seek him out. But some
impulse in her&mdash;friendliness, remorse, fear, curiosity, all had
their share in it&mdash;drove her on. Very softly she turned the
handle and opened the door.</p>

<p>Yes, he was there. He was sitting in a chair by the table.
His arms were spread on the table, the hands meeting one
another, and his head rested on his hands. He did not hear
the door she opened so gently. He looked as if he were asleep.
Then, softly still, she closed the door, standing close by it.
This time he heard the noise, slight as it was, and lifted his
face from his hands. When he saw her, he slowly raised himself
till he sat straight in his chair. She advanced towards
him timidly, with a deprecatory smile.</p>

<p>In disuse the room had grown dreary, as rooms do; the
furniture showed a housemaid's stiff ideas of arrangement;
there was no human untidiness; even the air was rather
musty.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't look very cheerful in here! Have you
been asleep, Arthur?" She sat herself sideways on the
heavy mahogany writing-table.</p>

<p>He shook his head; his eyes looked very tired.</p>

<p>"I couldn't think what had become of you. And I wanted
to say good-night. We're&mdash;we're friends, aren't we, Cousin
Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Where's Oliver Wyse?" he asked brusquely.</p>

<p>"Upstairs in his room&mdash;writing letters. He went almost
as soon as you did&mdash;but more politely!" Her smile made
the reproof an overture to friendship.</p>

<p>"I hate to see the fellow with you," he broke out fiercely,
but in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't say things like that! What nonsense
have you got into your head? Sir Oliver's just a friend&mdash;as
you are. Not the same quite, because you're a relation too.
But still just a very good friend, as you are. Is this all because
I told you you ought not to neglect your work?"</p>

<p>"Why are you so anxious for me to clear out?"</p>

<p>"If you take it like that, I can't&mdash;well, we can't talk.
I must just leave you alone." She got down from the table
and stood by it, ready, as it seemed, to carry out her threat
of going.</p>

<p>"I'll go to London&mdash;if you'll tell Oliver Wyse to come
with me."</p>

<p>"He's only just come, poor man&mdash;and only for a few days,
anyhow! I think you've gone mad. Who's been putting
such things in your head? Is it&mdash;Godfrey?"</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be surprised if it was, would you?" he
asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I should, though Godfrey is sometimes very absurd
with his fancies. I don't want to quarrel, but you really
mustn't grudge my having another friend. It's not reasonable.
And if Sir Oliver does admire me a little&mdash;well, is that
so surprising?" She smiled coaxingly, very anxious to
make friends to-night, to part friends on the morrow. "After
all, aren't you a little guilty in that way yourself, Cousin
Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Not in the same&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but broke off, frowning
and fretful.</p>

<p>"I've spoilt you, but I never promised you a monopoly.
Now be good and sensible, do! Forget all this nonsense; go
and do your work, and come back next week."</p>

<p>He made no reply to her appeal; he sat looking at her
with a hostile scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, you can't stay if you're going on behaving like
this. It's intolerable."</p>

<p>"I came here on Godfrey's invitation. If Godfrey asks me
to go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you appeal to Godfrey, you're not a friend of mine!"
she cried hotly.</p>

<p>"Impossible to be a friend both of yours and of Godfrey's,
is it?" he sneered.</p>

<p>Her face flushed; now she was very angry. "Go or stay&mdash;anyhow
I've done with you!" She half-turned away,
yet waited a moment still, hoping that his mood would
soften.</p>

<p>He leant forward towards her in entreaty. "Don't do it,
Bernadette, for God's sake! For your own sake, for the sake
of all of us who love you!"</p>

<p>"Who loves me in this house?" she asked sharply and
scornfully. "Am I so much to any of them? What am I to
Godfrey, for instance? Does Godfrey love me?" She was
glad to give utterance to her great excuse.</p>

<p>But his mind was not on excuses or palliation; they belonged
to his old feelings about her, and it was the new
feeling which governed him now. He stretched out his arm,
caught one of her hands, and drew her towards him almost
roughly.</p>

<p>"I love you, Bernadette, I love you body and soul, I
worship you!"</p>

<p>"Arthur!" she cried in amazement, shrinking, trying to
draw back.</p>

<p>"When I see that man with you, and know what he wants,
and suspect&mdash;It drives me mad, I can't bear it. Oh, it's
all damnable of me, I know! I could have gone on all right
as we were, and been happy, but for this. But now, when I
think of him, I&mdash;&mdash;" With a shiver he let go her hands and
buried his face in his own again. His shoulders shook as
though with a sob, though no sound came.</p>

<p>She drew near to him now of her own accord, came and
stood just beside him, laying her hand gently on his shoulder.
"Cousin Arthur, Cousin Arthur!" she whispered. All her
anger was gone; sorrow for him swallowed it up. "You're
making a mistake, you know, you are really. You don't love
me&mdash;not like that. You never did. You never felt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He raised his head. "What's the use of talking about
what I did do or did feel? I know all that. It's what I do
feel that's the question&mdash;what I feel now!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but you can't have changed in four or five hours,"
she pleaded gently, yet with a little smile. "That's absurd.
You're mistaken about yourself. It's just that you're angry
about Oliver&mdash;angry and jealous. And that makes you think
you love me. But you never would! To begin with, you're
too loyal, too honest, too fond of&mdash;Oh, you'd never do it!"</p>

<p>"I had never thought of you as&mdash;in that way. But when
I saw him, he made me do it. And then&mdash;yes, all of a sudden!"
He turned his eyes up to her, but imploring mercy rather than
favour.</p>

<p>She pressed his shoulder affectionately. "Yes, I suppose
it's possible&mdash;it might be like that with a man," she said. "I
suppose it might. I never thought of it. But only just for a
moment, Cousin Arthur! It's not real with you. You'll get
over it directly; you'll forget it, and think of me in the old
pleasant way you used, as being&mdash;&mdash;" With another little
squeeze on his shoulder she laughed low&mdash;"Oh, all the
wonderful things I know you thought me!" She suddenly
recollected how she stood. She drew in her breath sharply,
with a sound almost like a sob. "Ah, no, you can never
think like that of me again, can you?"</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment, not looking up at her now, but
straight in front of him.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;it's true?" he asked.</p>

<p>With a forlorn shake of her head she answered, "Yes, it's
true. Since you're like this, I can't keep it up any longer.
It's all true. Oliver loves me, and I love him, and all you
suspected is&mdash;well, is going to be true about us."</p>

<p>"If you'll only drop that, I swear I'll never breathe a word
about&mdash;about myself! I will forget! I'll go away till I have
forgotten. I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, poor boy, I know you would. I should absolutely
trust you. But how am I to&mdash;drop that?" She smiled ruefully.
"It's become just my life." She suddenly lifted her
hands above her head and cried in a low but passionate voice,
"Oh, I can't bear this! It's terrible. Don't be so miserable,
dear Arthur! I can't bear to see you!" She bent down and
kissed him on the forehead. "You who've been such a dear
dear friend and comrade to me&mdash;you who could have made me
go on enduring it all here if anybody could! But Oliver came&mdash;and
look what he's done to both of us!"</p>

<p>"You love him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, yes! Or how could all this be happening?
You must believe that. I didn't want you to know it&mdash;Yes,
you were right, I was trying to get you out of the way, I
wasn't honest. But since things have turned out like this, you
must believe now, indeed you must."</p>

<p>For a full minute he sat silent and motionless. Then he
reached up, took her hand, and kissed it three&mdash;four&mdash;times.
"God help me! Well, I'll go to London to-morrow. I can't
face him&mdash;or Godfrey. I should let it all out in a minute. I
can't think how you manage!"</p>

<p>To her too it looked very difficult to manage now. The
revelation made to Arthur seemed somehow to extend to the
whole household. She felt that everyone would be watching
and pointing, even though Arthur himself went away. She
had grown fearful of being found out&mdash;how quickly Arthur
had found her out!&mdash;and dreaded her husband's surly questions.
More scenes might come&mdash;more scenes not to be endured!
A sudden resolve formed itself in her mind, born of her
fear of more detection, of more scenes, of more falling into
disgrace.</p>

<p>"I expect Barber will have gone to bed&mdash;it's past eleven,"
she said. "But you can give him your orders in the morning.
And&mdash;and I shan't see you. Be happy, dear Cousin Arthur,
and, oh, splendidly successful! I'm sure you will! And now
go to bed and sleep, poor tired boy!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't sleep&mdash;not yet. This is good-bye?" His
voice choked on the word a little. He turned his chair round,
and she gave her hands into his.</p>

<p>"Yes, this must be good-bye&mdash;for the present at all events.
Perhaps some day, when all this is an old story, if you wish
it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you going away with him, or&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Oh, going away! I must do that. You do see that, don't
you? And Oliver wouldn't have anything else. Try to think
kindly and&mdash;and pleasantly of me. Remember our good
times, dear Arthur, not this&mdash;this awful evening!"</p>

<p>"I've been such a fool&mdash;and now such a blackguard!
Because now if I could, I'd&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush! Don't say things like that. They're not
really true, and they make you feel worse. We're just dear
old friends parting for a while, because we must."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I shall never see you again, Bernadette&mdash;and
you've been pretty nearly everything in my life since we've
known one another."</p>

<p>"Dear Arthur, you must let me go now. I can't bear any
more of it. Oh, I am so desperately sorry, Arthur!" A tear
rolled down her cheek.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Bernadette. It'll be all right about me.
And&mdash;well, I can't talk about you, but you needn't be afraid
of my thinking anything&mdash;anything unkind. Good-bye."</p>

<p>She drew her hands away, and he relinquished his hold on
them without resistance. There was no more to be said&mdash;no
more to be done. She stood where she was for a moment;
he turned his chair round to the table again, spread out his
arms, and laid his face on his hands. Just the same attitude
in which she had found him! But she knew that his distress
was deeper. Despair and forlornness succeeded to anger and
fear; and, on the top of them, the poor boy accused himself
of disloyalty to his house, to his cousin, to herself. He saw
himself a blackguard as well as a fool.</p>

<p>She could not help speaking to him once again. "God
bless you, Cousin Arthur," she said very softly. But he did
not move; he gave no sign of hearing her. She turned and
went very quietly out of the room, leaving her poor pet in sad
plight, her poor toy broken, behind her.</p>

<p>It was more than she had bargained for, more than she
could bear! Silently and cautiously, but with swift and
resolute steps, she passed along the corridor to the hall, and
mounted the stairs. She was bent on shutting out the vision
of Arthur from her sight.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

<h2>PRESSING BUSINESS</h2>


<p>Oliver Wyse had finished his letters and was smoking
a last cigar before turning in. Barber had brought
him whiskey and soda water, and wished him good-night,
adding that, in case Sir Oliver should want anything
in the night, he had put Wigram, his chauffeur, who acted as
valet also when his master was on a visit, in the small room
next the bathroom which Sir Oliver was to use. "He said he
liked to be within hail of you, Sir Oliver."</p>

<p>"Wigram's been with me in a lot of queer places, Barber.
He's got into the habit of expecting midnight alarms. In fact
he was a sort of bodyguard to begin with; then a valet; now
he's mainly a chauffeur&mdash;a very handy fellow! Well, thank
you, Barber&mdash;Good-night."</p>

<p>The cigar was pleasant; so was the whiskey-and-soda; he
felt drowsily content. The situation caused no disturbance
either in his nerves or in his conscience. He was accustomed
to critical positions and rather liked them; to break or to
observe rules and conventions was entirely a question of
expediency, to be settled as each case arose&mdash;and this case
was now abundantly settled. The only real danger had lain in
Bernadette herself; and she shewed no sign of wavering. He
had enjoyed the comedy of her wise counsel to Arthur, though
for his own part he cared little whether the boy went or stayed;
if need be, it could not be difficult to put him in his place.</p>

<p>A low light knock came on his door. A little surprised,
but fancying it must be the devoted Wigram come to have a
last look at him, he called, "Come in!" Bernadette darted
in and shut the door noiselessly. She held up a finger, enjoining
silence, and walked quickly across the room.</p>

<p>He threw his cigar into the grate, and advanced to meet
her, smiling. "I say&mdash;is this your 'tremendous caution'?"
But then he perceived the excitement under which she
laboured. "What's the matter? Anything gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Arthur! He's found out! And I&mdash;somehow I
couldn't deny it to him."</p>

<p>He smiled at her kindly and tolerantly, yet with a gentle
reproof. Her courage was failing her again, it seemed. It
was a good thing that he had come back to Hilsey&mdash;to keep her
up to the scratch.</p>

<p>"Well? Did he turn nasty? Never mind, I'll quiet him.
Where is he?"</p>

<p>"No, no, please don't go near him. He's not nasty; he's
all broken up. Oliver, he says he's in love with me himself."</p>

<p>He smiled at that. "Coming on, the young cousin, isn't
he? But I'm not much surprised, Bernadette."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he's upset me dreadfully. I didn't mean it to happen
like this. It's too much for me. My nerves&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She spoke all the time in quick agitated whispers. Oliver
walked to the door, turned the key, and came back to her. He
took one of her hands in his. She looked up at him with tears
in her eyes. "He has been such a friend really. He trusted
me so."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose he'll take your advice now&mdash;your wise
advice&mdash;and pack himself off to-morrow morning. Breakfast
in bed, and you needn't see him."</p>

<p>"Judith will guess&mdash;I know she will. Oliver, I&mdash;I can't
keep it up, with you here&mdash;not even though Arthur goes. I'm
afraid of Judith now&mdash;even of Godfrey!"</p>

<p>"I'm certainly not going to leave you here, up against it,
all by yourself." She was not to be trusted alone now. She
had been shewn too vividly the side of the shield which it was
his task to hide from her eyes&mdash;a task to which he alone was
equal. Left to herself, she might go back on the whole thing,
very likely!</p>

<p>"Take me away from it all now, won't you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What now&mdash;to-night?" His eyes lit up humorously.
"Sharp work, isn't it? Rather difficult to get out of the house
to-night without risking&mdash;well, encounters! And you wouldn't
like that."</p>

<p>"Can't you think of anything? I can't stand these next
few days."</p>

<p>He considered a moment, marshalling plans in his quick-moving
mind. "Look here, can you be sure of waking up
early in the morning?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could be half as sure of going to sleep at all!"</p>

<p>"Well, get up at half-past five&mdash;Your servants won't be
about then?&mdash;pack what you want in a bag, leave it just
inside your room, put on your things, and meet me outside
the hall-door just before six. We'll go for a walk!"</p>

<p>"But the station? It's nearly three miles off! And there
are no trains&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, wait! My man will fetch your bag&mdash;just a little
risk there, not much at that hour&mdash;hang my motor-coat over
it, so that nobody can see it isn't mine, and take it round to the
garage with my traps. I suppose the car'll be locked up, and
he'll have to get the key from somebody. He'll say that I'm
suddenly called away, that I've walked on ahead, and he's to
pick me up at the east lodge. If you're seen, you're just
putting me on my way, don't you see? He'll give your
fellow at the garage a sovereign, and he won't be too curious!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I see!" she whispered eagerly.</p>

<p>"Starting then, we can be in town in lots of time to catch the
afternoon train to Boulogne. I'll wire the yacht to meet us
somewhere else, instead of Southampton. Ostend, perhaps&mdash;that'd
do all right. Now how does that suit you?"</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled again. "Why, it's splendid!" How
difficulties seemed to vanish under his sure decisive touch! It
was by this gift, more than any other, that he had won and
held her.</p>

<p>"I've managed trickier businesses than this. It's all
perfectly easy, and with luck you won't be exposed to meeting
any of them again."</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"But you'd better not stay here now. One can never be
sure somebody won't come nosing about." He kissed her
lightly. "Go, be quick, to your room. I'll go and wake up
Wigram now, and tell him what I want; you needn't bother
about him&mdash;he's absolutely reliable. Come along." He drew
her across the room with him, unlocked the door and opened it.
"Don't make a noise! Just before six, in the porch, remember!"</p>

<p>She nodded in silence and glided quickly along the passage,
which was dimly lighted by a single oil lamp; Godfrey would
not hear of installing modern illuminants at Hilsey. He gave
her time to get to her room, and then himself went in the other
direction along the corridor, and knocked on the door of the
little room where the faithful and reliable Wigram slept.</p>

<p>He was soon back&mdash;it did not take long to make Wigram
understand what was wanted of him&mdash;and sat down again
at his writing-table. Some of the letters had to be re-written,
for he had dated them from Hilsey, and that would not do
now. He was smiling in a half-impatient amusement over
women and their whims. They were so prone to expect to get
all they wanted without paying the necessary price, without
the little drawbacks which could not be avoided. After all,
a woman couldn't reasonably expect to run away without
causing a bit of a rumpus, and some little distress to somebody!
It was very seldom in this world that either man or
woman could get all they wanted without putting somebody
else's nose out of joint; if only that were honestly acknowledged,
there would be a great deal less cant talked.</p>

<p>He raised his head from his work and paused, with his
cigar half-way to his mouth, to listen a moment to a slow
heavy tread which came along the passage from the top of the
stairs and stopped at a door on the opposite side, nearer to
the stairs. Arthur Lisle coming to bed&mdash;he had indicated his
own room in passing, when he was playing deputy-host and
showing Oliver his quarters. A good thing he hadn't come up
a little sooner! He might have met Bernadette coming out of
a room which it was by no means the proper thing for her to
have been in. Another painful encounter that would have
been! Again his tolerant smile came; he was really a good-natured
man; he liked Arthur and was sorry for him, even
while he was amused. To-night the world was probably
seeming quite at an end to that young fellow&mdash;that young
fool of a fellow. Whereas, in fact, he was just at the beginning
of all this sort of business!</p>

<p>"I suppose he wants my blood," he reflected. "That'd
make him feel a lot better. But he can't have it. I'm afraid
he can't, really!"</p>

<p>Well, Arthur's was one of the sound and primitive reasons
for wanting a man's blood; nothing to quarrel with there!
Only the thing would not last, of course. Quite soon it
would all be a memory, a bit of experience. At least that
would be so if the boy were&mdash;or managed to grow into, to let
life shape him into&mdash;a sensible fellow. Many men went on
being fools about women to the end. "Well, I suppose some
people would say that I'm being a fool now," he added candidly.
"Perhaps I am. Well, she's worth it." With a smile
he finished off his work, got himself to bed briskly, and was
soon asleep.</p>

<p>Sick at last of the dreary and musty room, Arthur had
slouched miserably to bed&mdash;though he was sure that he
could not sleep. He could not think either, at least hardly
coherently. The ruin which had swooped down on him
was too overwhelming. And so quick! All in a few hours!
It seemed too great to understand, almost too great to feel.
It was, as it were, a devastation, a clean sweep of all the best
things in his life&mdash;his adoration for Bernadette, his loyalty
to Godfrey, the affection which had gathered in his heart for
these his kinsfolk, for this the home of his forefathers. A dull
numb pain of the soul afflicted him, such as a man might
feel in the body as he comes to consciousness after a stunning
blow. The future seemed impossible to face; he did not
know how to set about the task of reconstructing it. He was
past anger, past resentment; he did not want Oliver Wyse's
blood now. Was he not now even as Oliver, save that Oliver
was successful? And Oliver owed no loyalty to the man he
robbed. In the extravagance of his despair he called himself
the meanest of men as well as the most miserable. "My
God! my God!" he kept muttering to himself, in his hopeless
miserable desolation.</p>

<p>But he was young and very weary, exhausted with his
suffering. He had sworn to himself that sleep was impossible,
but nature soon had her way with him. Yet he struggled
against sleep, for on it must follow a bitter awakening.</p>

<p>When he did awake, it was broad daylight. From his bed,
which stood between the two windows of the room, he could
see the sunlight playing on the opposite wall to his right; to
the left the wall was still in shadow. It seemed that he must
have pulled up the blind of one window and not of the other,
before he got into bed, though he did not remember doing it.
Indeed at the first awakening he recollected nothing very
distinctly. The memories of the night before took a minute
or two to acquire distinctness, to sort themselves out. Presently
he gave a low dull groan and turned on his side again,
refusing to face the morning&mdash;the future that awaited him
inexorably. But another memory came to him in a queer
quick flash&mdash;Judith's smile when she told him that Godfrey
had taken to his bed. With a muttered curse he drew his
watch from under the pillow. Half-past seven!</p>

<p>He raised himself on his elbow, his back turned to the light.
Everything became clear to memory now; and the end of it
all was that he had to go, and go quickly, as soon as he could,
by the earliest train possible. He did not want to see anybody;
above all he must not see Bernadette; he had promised her
that, practically; nor could he himself bear another meeting
and another parting. Joe Halliday and Wills and Mayne won
the day&mdash;by the help of an alliance most unlooked-for!</p>

<p>A voice spoke from the window to his right&mdash;where the
blind was pulled up and the fresh morning air blew in through
the opened sash. "So you're awake at last, Arthur!"</p>

<p>He rolled over on to his other elbow in surprise, blinking
at the strong light. Judith was sitting on the broad low seat
beneath the window. She wore a walking dress and out-of-door
boots, but her hair was only carelessly caught together;
she wore no hat. She smiled at him, but her eyes looked red
and she held her handkerchief tightly squeezed in one
hand.</p>

<p>"Why, what are you doing here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been crying&mdash;not that that's any use. I've
been here nearly half-an-hour. I meant to wake you, but you
looked so awfully tired. Besides, it was too late."</p>

<p>"Too late for what?"</p>

<p>"He's taken her away, Arthur."</p>

<p>He did not move; propped up on his elbow, he looked at
her with a morose steadfastness.</p>

<p>"I'm generally out before breakfast, you know, with Patsy.
I didn't sleep well last night, and I was earlier than usual. I
was out by half-past six, and went for a walk in the meadows.
Coming back, I passed the garage; Stokes was cleaning the
car and I stopped to speak to him about the new puppy&mdash;he's
not very well. I noticed Sir Oliver's car wasn't there, and he
told me that Sir Oliver's man had knocked him up and made
him unlock the garage an hour before. The man brought
Sir Oliver's luggage from the house, Stokes said, and told him
that Sir Oliver had walked on ahead, and he was to pick him
up. Stokes asked where they were going, and the man said
home, he supposed, but Sir Oliver hadn't told him. The man
was rather short with him, Stokes said, and seemed in a hurry.
I thought it all sounded rather funny, especially Sir Oliver
walking on ahead&mdash;at six in the morning!&mdash;but I said nothing
to Stokes, though I think he thought it a bit queer too. So
when I got back I went to Bernadette's room. I didn't exactly
suspect that she'd gone too, but I had a sort of uneasy&mdash;well,
I wanted to be quite sure, don't you know? I opened the door
quietly&mdash;a little way&mdash;and I saw that the room was quite
light. That told me directly; she can't bear a chink of light
in her room. So I went in. She wasn't there; she hadn't
been to bed, she'd only lain down on the outside. Most of the
things on her dressing-table were gone, and I couldn't see the
dressing-bag that always stood by her big hanging-cupboard.
I thought I'd better come and tell you. On the way I met
Barber, just up, I suppose, in his apron and shirt-sleeves. He
told me that Sir Oliver had gone and Wigram&mdash;his man, you
know&mdash;too."</p>

<p>"But Stokes didn't see either of them?"</p>

<p>"No. They must have walked on together, and got into the
car when it came up. Only just then I remembered that I'd
found the front door unlocked and had meant to scold Barber
for being so careless. It had gone out of my head till then."
She paused a moment. "Did you see her last night? She
wanted to see you&mdash;asked where you'd gone, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes; she came to me in the smoking-room."</p>

<p>"Did she say anything that sounded like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He waited a while before he answered the unfinished question.
"She said nothing about this morning."</p>

<p>"But did she say&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Arthur nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Oh then, it's quite clear!" said Judith.</p>

<p>"I didn't think she meant to go this morning. I was to go.
We said good-bye."</p>

<p>"She has gone, though. I'm sure of it. Well, I've thought
she would for some time past, so I don't quite see why I've
been crying. How could we help it? Could we give her what
she wanted? Could Godfrey? Could I? Could you? Margaret
was the only chance, but poor little Margaret's&mdash;well,
Margaret! She wasn't enough to keep her." She rose from her
seat. "Well, I'll go, because you must get up."</p>

<p>Arthur paid no heed. "I think it's because of me that she's
gone this morning," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"Why? Did you quarrel? Did you talk about&mdash;about Sir
Oliver?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at first. Then I told her I was in love with her."</p>

<p>She raised her hands and let them fall in a gesture of
despairing irritation. "In love, in love! Oh, I've had enough
of it for the present! Get up, Arthur!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll get up&mdash;get up and clear out," he said in sullen
bitterness. "I'll go back to work; that's the best thing I can
do. I meant to go this morning, anyhow."</p>

<p>She had moved towards the door, but she stopped now,
facing him, between bed and door. "You mean that you're
going away&mdash;now&mdash;this morning?" He nodded his head. She
waited a moment and then smiled. "Oh, well, I think I'll
come too. After all, it won't be very lively here, will it?"</p>

<p>He started in surprise. "You go? You couldn't think of
that, Judith? Why, what's little Margaret to do? And
Godfrey? Oh, you can't go!"</p>

<p>"Why can't I? I'm a Lisle, aren't I? I'm a Lisle, just
as much as you and Godfrey! Why aren't I to behave as a
Lisle then&mdash;go to bed or run away when things get difficult
and uncomfortable? I rather wish I had a real man to run
away with&mdash;like Bernadette!"</p>

<p>"God help him if you had!" growled Arthur, to whom the
insinuation was not grateful.</p>

<p>"That's better! You have got a bit of a fight somewhere in
you," she mocked. "And anyhow&mdash;get up!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to&mdash;if you'll clear out, and be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And be damned to me? Yes, I know! You can say that
as often as you like, but you've got to help me to face this
business. You've got to be the Man of the Family!" She
smiled rather scornfully. "It's the least you can do, if you
really did try to make love to Bernadette."</p>

<p>He flushed a little, but answered calmly: "As I don't
suppose you'll be able to think of anything to say more
disagreeable than that, you may as well go, and let me
dress."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will." She turned to the door, smiling in a grim
triumph. Just as she went out, she looked over her shoulder
and added, "You'll have to tell Godfrey."</p>

<p>That gave him a chance. He cried after her, "You're in
a funk too, really!"</p>

<p>She smiled at him. "Didn't I say I was a Lisle&mdash;or half a
one&mdash;like you, Arthur?" She pulled the door to, with a bang,
and he heard her quick decisive steps retreating along the
corridor.</p>

<p>The next moment Barber entered the room, bringing hot
water. He had seen Judith as she came out. Only another of
the queer things happening this morning! He wore an air of
tremendously discreet gravity. But Arthur guessed from his
face that wonder and surmise, speculation and gossip, were
afloat in the house already.</p>

<p>He dressed quickly and went down to breakfast. Judith
was there alone; Margaret was having breakfast upstairs
with the nurse, she told him&mdash;out of the way of chattering
tongues, her look added&mdash;as she poured out coffee.</p>

<p>Barber came in with a telegram, and laid it by her. "The
boy's waiting, miss."</p>

<p>She read it. "No answer, Barber."</p>

<p>"Oh, I want to send a wire. Bring me a form, will you?"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>When he had written his message, Judith rose and came
round to him, carrying his coffee in one hand and the telegram
in the other; she gave him the latter to read&mdash;"Don't expect
me back. Shall write you." There was no signature.</p>

<p>"What does she want to write about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, her things, I suppose. What did you say in your
wire?"</p>

<p>"I said 'Awfully sorry can't come. Pressing family
business.'"</p>

<p>"It is&mdash;very. I'm afraid I was rather disagreeable, Arthur."</p>

<p>He looked up at her with a rueful smile as he stirred his
coffee. "You're like a cold bath on a freezing morning&mdash;stinging
but hygienic."</p>

<p>There was a sudden choke in her voice as she answered:
"I'd have said and done anything rather than let you go.
And if I've ruined your play and your prospects, I can't help
it." She walked quickly away to the window and stood there
a moment with her back towards him. Then she returned to
her place and ate a business-like breakfast.</p>

<h2>FACING THE SITUATION</h2>


<p>The gods were laughing at him; so it seemed to
Arthur Lisle. They chose to chastise his folly and
his sin by ridicule. He whom the catastrophe&mdash;the
intrigue and the flight&mdash;had broken was chosen to break
the news of it. He must put on a composed consolatory face,
preach fortitude, recommend patience under the inevitable.
He was plumped back into his old position of useful cousin,
the friend of both husband and wife. Judith was that too.
Why should not she carry the tidings? "No, you'll be more
sympathetic," she insisted, with the old touch of mockery
governing her manner again. "I should tell him too much
of the truth most likely." So he must do it. But this useful
cousin seemed a very different sort of man from the stricken
sufferer, the jealous lover, of overnight. Indeed it was pitiable
for the forsaken jealous lover&mdash;denied even a departure from
the scene of his woes, condemned to dwell in the house so full
of her and yet so empty, the butt (so his sensitive fancy
imagined) of half the gossip and half the giggles of which to
his ears Hilsey Manor was already full. But the forsaken lover
must sink himself in the sympathetic kinsman&mdash;if he could;
must wear his face and speak in his tones. A monstrous
hypocrisy! "Bernadette's run away, but, I'm sorry to say,
not with me, Godfrey." No, no, that was all wrong&mdash;that
was the truth. "Bernadette's left you for Oliver Wyse&mdash;unprincipled
woman and artful villain!" Was that right?
Well, 'artful villain' was right enough, surely? Perhaps
'deluded woman' would do for Bernadette. "Brave woman
and happy man!" the rude laughter of the gods suggested.
"If we'd either of us had half his grit, Godfrey!" All sorts
of things impossible to say the gods invented in their high
but disconcerting irony.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm in for it&mdash;here goes!" thought Arthur, as he
requested Barber to find out from Mrs. Gates&mdash;who had been
acting as nurse to her master as well as to his little girl&mdash;when
Mr. Lisle could see him.</p>

<p>Gossip and giggles there may have been somewhere,
probably there were, but not on the faces or in the demeanour
of Barber and Mrs. Gates. Pomp, funereal pomp! They
seemed sure that Bernadette was dead, and that her death
was a suicide.</p>

<p>"I will ascertain immediately, sir," said Barber. He was
really very human over it all&mdash;a mixture of shockedness and
curiosity, condemnation and comprehension, outrage and
excuse&mdash;for she certainly had a way with her, Mrs. Lisle had.
But his sense of appropriateness overpowered them all&mdash;a
result, no doubt, of the ceremonial nature of his vocation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gates's humanity was more on the ample surface of
her ample personality. She made no pretence of not understanding
what had happened, and even went a little further
than that.</p>

<p>"Lor, sir, well there!" she whispered to Arthur. "I've
'ad my fears. Yes, he can see you, poor gentleman! I've
not said a word to 'im. And poor Miss Margaret!" She was
bent on getting every ounce out of the situation. Arthur did
not want to kill her&mdash;she was a good woman&mdash;but it would
have relieved his feelings to jab a penknife into one of the
wide margins around her vital parts. "Why is she so fat?"
he groaned inwardly and with no superficial relevance. But
his instinct was true; her corpulence did, in the most correct
sense, aggravate the present qualities of her emotions and
demeanour.</p>

<p>And so, in varying forms, the thing was running all through
the house&mdash;and soon would run all through the village.
Mrs. Lisle&mdash;Mrs. Lisle of Hilsey! Portentous, horrible&mdash;and
most exciting! It would run to London soon. Mrs. Lisle of
Hilsey was not such a personage there&mdash;but still pretty well
known. A good many people had been at that party where
the Potentates had met. One of them had abdicated now
and gone&mdash;well, perhaps only as far as Elba!</p>

<p>All the air was full of her, all the voices speaking her name
in unison. The sympathetic cousin had great difficulty in
getting on the top of the defeated lover when Arthur entered
Godfrey's room. And even anyhow&mdash;if one left out all the
irony and all the complication&mdash;the errand was not an easy
or a grateful one. If Godfrey had gone to bed sooner than
witness a flirtation, what mightn't he do in face of an elopement?</p>

<p>The invalid was sitting up in bed, supported by several
pillows, smoking a cigarette and reading yesterday's "Times."
The improvement in his temper, manifest from the moment
when he took to his bed, seemed to have been progressive.
He made Arthur welcome.</p>

<p>"And I hope you've not come to say good-bye?" he added.
Arthur had mentioned to him too the call to London and to
work.</p>

<p>"No, I'm going to stay on a few days more, if you can put
me up. I say, Godfrey&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Delighted to keep you&mdash;especially when I'm on my back.
I hope to be up soon, though, very soon. Er&mdash;Wyse is staying
on too, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"He left this morning, early, by motor."</p>

<p>"Did he? Really?" He smothered his relief, but it was
unmistakable. "Rather sudden, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was sudden. The fact is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why did he go? Is he coming back?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;well, I mean, he didn't say anything to me.
No, he won't be back."</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose he told Bernadette about it. I thought I
heard somebody moving about the house. I'm a light sleeper,
you know, especially when I'm ill. About six o'clock, I
think it was. I&mdash;I suppose Bernadette's disappointed at his
not staying longer?" The assumed indifference of his question
was contradicted by the eagerness of his furtive glance.
Arthur felt it on him; he flushed as he sat down by the bedside,
seeking so hard for a form of words, for an opening&mdash;something
enlightening without being brutal. Godfrey's
eyes, sharpened by his ill-will and suspicion, marked the flush
and the hesitation; he guessed there was something to tell.
"Well?" he added, peevish at getting no immediate answer.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she's gone away too this morning, Godfrey&mdash;early&mdash;before
we were up."</p>

<p>A lean hand shot out from the bed and grasped his wrist.
"Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, old chap, I'm sorry to say&mdash;it's a bad business."</p>

<p>"You do mean&mdash;&mdash;? Arthur, you do mean&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's gone with him." He could not look at Godfrey;
his speech was no more than a mutter. He felt the grasp on
his wrist tighten, till it hurt him.</p>

<p>"The damned villain! I knew it! The infernal villain,
Arthur!" Godfrey cried querulously.</p>

<p>Clearly an assent was required. Arthur's was inadequate.
"Awfully bad business! Try to&mdash;to be calm, old fellow,
while I tell you about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, tell me!"</p>

<p>There was really nothing material left to tell, but Godfrey
was greedy for details; such as there were to tell or conjecture
he extracted by rapid questioning, even to the telegram which
had come for Judith. Not till the end did he relax his hold
on Arthur's wrist and lean back again on his pillows.</p>

<p>He lay silent like that for a long time, with Arthur silent
beside him. His rage against Oliver seemed spent almost in
the moment of its outburst; to his companion's relief he
said nothing about Bernadette's conduct. He lay pathetically
quiet, looking tired now, rather than angry or distressed.
At last he gave a long sigh. "Well, we know where we are
now!" he said.</p>

<p>That piece of knowledge had come to more than one inmate
of the house in the last twelve hours.</p>

<p>"We must face the situation, Arthur. It's come to a
crisis! I think I'm equal to getting up and&mdash;and facing the
situation."</p>

<p>"Well, you know, there's no particular use in your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My feelings are&mdash;well, you can imagine them." ("More
or less!" threw in the gods, grimly chuckling.) "But I
mustn't think of myself only. There's Margaret and&mdash;and
all of it. Yes, I shall get up. I shall get up and sit in my
chair, Arthur." He was silent again for a minute. "It makes
a great difference. I&mdash;I shall have to consider my course&mdash;what's
best in the interests of all of us. A terrible blow! It
must be a blow even to you, Arthur? You and she were such
good friends, weren't you? And she does this&mdash;she lets herself
be seduced into doing this!"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, it's&mdash;it's a blow; but it's you and Margaret
we've got to think about."</p>

<p>"No, I don't forget you, I don't forget you!" ("If only
he would!" groaned Arthur.) "Well, I must consider my
course. Where did you say the telegram was sent from?"</p>

<p>"Winchester."</p>

<p>"I expect they stopped to breakfast there."</p>

<p>"Very likely." Arthur rose to his feet; he did not enjoy
a "reconstruction" of the flight. The afflicted husband made
no protest against his movement.</p>

<p>"Yes, leave me alone for a little while. I have to think&mdash;I
must review the position. Tell Judith I should like to see
her in about an hour's time, and&mdash;and go into matters."</p>

<p>Happy to escape, Arthur left him facing the situation,
reviewing the position, considering his course, and determining
to get up&mdash;to get, at any rate, into his arm-chair&mdash;the better
to perform these important operations. The messenger of
catastrophe came away with a strange impression of the effect
of his tidings. After the first outburst&mdash;itself rather peevish
than passionate&mdash;came that idle, almost morbid curiosity
about details from which he himself instinctively averted his
eyes; then this ineffectual fussiness, this vain self-assertion,
which turned to facing the situation only when there was no
longer anything or anybody to face, and to reviewing the
position only when it was past mending. Of smitten love,
even of pride wounded to the heart, there seemed little sign.
All Arthur's feelings fought against the sacrilegious idea, but
it would not be denied an entry into his mind&mdash;after the
querulous anger, after the curiosity, mingling with the futile
fussiness, there had been an undercurrent of relief&mdash;relief that
nothing and nobody had to be faced really, that really nothing
could be done, nothing expected from him, no call made now
on courage or on energy&mdash;no, nor on a love or a sympathy
already dead before Oliver Wyse struck them the final
blow.</p>

<p>That morning's flight, then, was not the tragedy, but the
end of it, not the culminating scene of terror and pity, but
the fall of the curtain on a play played-out. Whatever of
good or evil in life it might bring for Bernadette, for Godfrey
it brought relief in its train. It was grievous, no doubt, in
its external incidents&mdash;a society scandal, a family shame&mdash;but
in itself, in its true significance to his mind, as it really
and closely touched his heart, it came as an end&mdash;an end to
the strain which he could not support, to the challenge which
he dared not face, on which he had turned his back in sulks
and malingering&mdash;an end to his long fruitless effort to be a
satisfactory husband.</p>

<p>When Judith came down from her interview and joined
Arthur in the garden before lunch, she had another aspect of
the case to exhibit, a sidelight to throw on the deserted man's
mind and its workings.</p>

<p>"How did you find him?" Arthur asked her.</p>

<p>"Oh, quite calm&mdash;and immersed in his account-books."
She smiled. "Yes, he's up, in his chair, and a pile of them
on the table at his elbow! He says that the first thing to do
is to reduce his expenditure. He hopes now to be able to
pay off his mortgage in four or five years. She was awfully
extravagant, you know, and he hated mortgaging Hilsey."</p>

<p>"Do you think she knew he'd had to do it?"</p>

<p>"No, she didn't. He wouldn't let her know. He liked her
to think him richer than he was, I think."</p>

<p>"Then he has no right to grumble at her extravagance."</p>

<p>"I never heard him do that&mdash;and he didn't do it this morning.
All the same it worried him, and now he can save, oh,
enormously, of course! The barouche and the pair of horses
are to go, the first thing."</p>

<p>The barouche! It carried his mind back to the beginning,
when its costly luxury framed for his eyes their earliest picture
of Bernadette's dainty beauty.</p>

<p>"If he isn't going to keep it, he might send it after her. I
would."</p>

<p>"Yes, you'd do a lot of foolish things if you were let.
Luckily you're not!"</p>

<p>"Judith, I half believe he's glad!"</p>

<p>"Need we admit quite so much as that? Let's say he's
facing the situation manfully!"</p>

<p>"Oh, he talked like that to you too, did he?" He jumped
up, and took a few paces about the lawn, then came back
and stood beside her. "By God, if he's glad, she was right
to go, Judith!"</p>

<p>"I've never said anything to the contrary, have I? Have
you seen Margaret this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. What made you ask me that just now?"</p>

<p>"She came into my head. After all, she's a&mdash;a factor in
the situation which, as Godfrey observes, has to be faced. I
suppose I shall have to adopt her&mdash;more or less. Premature
cares! Not so much Rome and Florence! It's as well to
realise where one comes in oneself. When Godfrey talks of
facing the situation, I don't think he proposes to do it alone,
you know. You and I come into it."</p>

<p>"Yes." He added after a pause: "Well, we can't turn
our backs on him, can we?"</p>

<p>"I've told her that her mother's gone on a visit&mdash;suddenly,
to see a friend who's ill&mdash;and didn't like to wake her
up to say good-bye. But that's a temporary solution, of
course. She'll have to know more, and something'll have to
be arranged about her and Bernadette. I don't suppose he'll
object to Bernadette seeing her sometimes." She ended with
a smile: "Perhaps you'll be asked to take her and be present
at the interviews&mdash;and see that Sir Oliver's off the premises."</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I do anything of the sort! And, as you
asked me to stay here, I don't think you need go on laughing
at me."</p>

<p>Judith was impenitent. "It's a thing quite likely to
happen," she insisted. "Bernadette would like it."</p>

<p>He turned away angrily and resumed his pacing. Yet in
his heart he assented to the tenor of her argument. She
might, in her malice, take an extravagant case&mdash;a case which,
at all events, seemed to him just now cruelly extravagant&mdash;but
she was right in her main contention. No more than she
herself could he turn his back on Godfrey, or cut himself
adrift from Hilsey. In last night's desperate hour Bernadette
and he, between them, seemed to have cut all the bonds
and severed all the ties; his only impulse had been to get
away quickly. But it could not be so. Life was not like that&mdash;at
least not to men who owned the sway of obligations and
felt the appeal of loyalty and affection. He could not desert
the ship.</p>

<p>Barber came out of the house and brought him a note.
"From Mr. Beard, sir. Will you kindly send a verbal
answer?"</p>

<p>He read it, and glanced towards Judith. He was minded
to consult her. But, no, he would not consult Judith. He
would decide for himself; something in the present position
made him put a value on deciding for himself, even though
he decided wrongly. "All right, say I will, Barber." He lit
a cigarette and, walking back to Judith, sat down again
beside her. But he said nothing; he waited for her to ask,
if she were curious.</p>

<p>She was. "What did Barber want?"</p>

<p>"Only a note from Beard&mdash;about the match. We shall be
one man short anyhow, and two if I don't turn up. So I told
Barber to say I would."</p>

<p>"Good. Margaret and I will come and watch you. We've
not gone into official mourning yet, I imagine."</p>

<p>"Hang 'em, they may think what they like! I'm going
to play cricket."</p>

<p>So he played cricket, though that again would not have
seemed possible over-night, and, notwithstanding that his
eye might well have been out, he made five-and-twenty runs
and brought off a catch of a most comforting order. Hilsey
won the match by four wickets, and Judith, Margaret, and
he strolled back home together in the cool of the evening,
while the setting sun gilded the mellow and peaceful beauties
of the old house.</p>

<p>The little girl held Judith's hand, and, excited by the
incidents of the game, above all by Cousin Arthur's dashing
innings&mdash;his style was rather vigorous than classic&mdash;prattled
more freely than her wont.</p>

<p>"I wish mummy hadn't had to go away just to-day," she
said. "Then she could have seen Cousin Arthur's innings.
I wanted to cry when he was caught out."</p>

<p>Arthur applied the words in parable, smiling grimly at
himself in his pain. He had been crying himself at being
caught out, and at mummy's having had to go away that
morning. But he mustn't do it. He must set his teeth,
however sore the pain, however galling the consciousness of
folly. Surely, in face of what had happened to that house,
nobody but an idiot&mdash;nobody but a man unable to learn even
words of one syllable in the book of life&mdash;could be content to
meet trouble with sighs and sulks, or with cries only and
amorous lamentation? Not to feel to the depths of his being
the shattering blow, or lightly and soon to forget it&mdash;that
could not be, nor did his instinct ask it; it would argue
shallowness indeed, and a cheapening of all that was good
and generous in him, a cheapening too of her who, towards
him at least, had ever been generous and good. What had
he, of all men, against her? Had she not given him all she
could&mdash;joy, comradeship, confidence in all things save that
one? In the crisis of her own fate, when she was risking all
her fortunes on that momentous throw, had she not paused,
had she not turned aside, to pity him and to be very tender
towards his foolishness? Was his the hand to cast at her
the stone of an ungrateful or accusing memory?</p>

<p>They passed through the tall iron gates which, with a true
squirearchical air, guarded the precincts of Hilsey Manor.</p>

<p>"Why, look, there's papa in the garden, walking on the
lawn!" cried Margaret.</p>

<p>Yes, there was Godfrey, heavily wrapped in shawls,
walking to and fro briskly. He had got up and come downstairs&mdash;to
face the situation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

<h2><i>DID YOU SAY MRS.?</i></h2>


<p>The end of another fortnight found Arthur still at
Hilsey, but on the eve of leaving it for a time at
least. Another summons had reached him, one
which he could not disregard. His mother wrote, affectionately
reproaching him for delaying his visit to Malvern. "You
promised us to come before this. Besides I'm not very well,
and you'll cheer me up. You mustn't altogether forsake us
for the other branch of the family!"</p>

<p>Arthur recognised his duty, but with a reluctance of which
he was ashamed. Common disaster had drawn the party at
Hilsey more closely together. Judith and Arthur, working
hand in hand to "make things go," had become firm friends,
though they were apt to spar and wrangle still. The little
girl&mdash;she knew by now that her mother's visit was to be a
long one&mdash;responded to the compassionate tenderness evoked
by a misfortune which she herself did not yet understand;
she gained confidence from marks of love and, as she claimed
affection more boldly, elicited it in ampler measure.</p>

<p>Freed from a struggle to which he was morbidly conscious
of being unequal, Godfrey Lisle showed his better side. Aggressive
courage was what he lacked and knew that he lacked;
he was not without fortitude to endure the pain of a blow that
had fallen&mdash;especially when he could be sure it was the last!
He was at peace now; the worst possible had happened&mdash;and,
lo, it was not unendurable! There were compensations; he
was not humiliated any more, and the sad leak in his finances&mdash;it
had threatened even his tenure of Hilsey itself&mdash;could
be stopped. Though he was still fussy, self-important over
trifles, sometimes ridiculous, and very dependent on his
stronger kinsfolk, he was more amiable, less secretive of his
feelings, free from sulks and grievances. The gentleman in
him came out, both in his bearing towards those about him and
in the attitude he adopted towards Bernadette herself. He
spoke of her as seldom as he could but without rancour, and
in regard to future arrangements put himself at her disposal.
When letters came from Oliver Wyse's lawyers, acting on
instructions received from the voyagers on summer seas, he
caused Arthur to reply for him that he would give her the
freedom she desired, and would endeavour to meet whatever
might be her wishes in regard to Margaret. He was scrupulous&mdash;and
even meticulous&mdash;over setting aside all her personal
belongings to await her orders. He declared himself ready
to consider any pecuniary arrangement which might be
thought proper; some relics of his old pride in lavishly supplying
all her requirements seemed to survive in his mind, side
by side with his relief at the thought of paying off his mortgage.</p>

<p>To Arthur the quiet after the storm brought a more sober
view of himself and of his life, of what he had done and what
had happened to him. His eyes saw more clearly for what
they were both the high-flying adoration and the tempestuous
gust of passion which jealousy had raised. A critical and
healthy distrust of himself and his impulses began gradually
to displace the bitter and morbid self-contempt of the first
hours and days after the disaster. He must still grieve with
the forsaken worshipper of the smoking-room; he could not
yet forget the pangs of the baffled lover; but a new man was
coming to birth in him&mdash;one who, if he still grieved and
sighed, could come near to smiling too at these extravagant
gentlemen with their idolising dreams and gusty passions.
Rueful and bitter the smile might be, but it was tonic. It
helped to set devotion, passion, and catastrophe in their true
places and to assign to them their real proportions. In it was
the dawn of a recognition that he was still no more than on
the threshold of a man's experience.</p>

<p>Neither was it a bad thing perhaps that another and very
practical trouble began to press him hard. Though he was
living in free quarters now, the bills contracted during his
great London season began to come tumbling in, many for the
second or third time. "To account rendered" was a legend
with which he was becoming familiar to the point of disgust.
The five hundred pounds was running very low; the diminished
dividends could not meet his deficit. When Godfrey
talked finance to him, as he often did, he was inclined to retort
that there were finances in a more desperate condition than
those of the estate of Hilsey and possessing no such new-born
prospects of recovery&mdash;prospects born in sore travail, it is
true, but there all the same for Godfrey's consolation.</p>

<p>But there was the farce! That persevering project emerged
on the horizon again. It was in full rehearsal now; it was
due in three weeks' time: it had got a third act at last, Mr.
Claud Beverley and Mr. Langley Etheringham having apparently
assuaged their differences. It had even got a name&mdash;a
name, as Joe Halliday wrote in his enthusiasm, as superior to
the name of <i>Help Me Out Quickly</i> as the play itself was to that
bygone masterpiece. Arthur told Judith the name and, in
spite of that resolution of his about relying on his own judgment,
awaited her opinion anxiously. After all, in this case
it was not his judgment, but, presumably, Mr. Claud Beverley's.</p>

<p>"'<i>Did You Say Mrs.?</i>' That's what you're going to call
it, is it?"</p>

<p>"It's what they're going to call it. It's not my invention,
you know."</p>

<p>"Well, I should think it must be vulgar enough, anyhow,"
said Judith.</p>

<p>"Oh, vulgar be hanged! That doesn't matter. Jolly good,
I call it! Sort of piques your curiosity. Why did He say
Mrs.?&mdash;That's what the public'll want to know, don't you
see?"</p>

<p>"Or why did She say Mrs. perhaps!"</p>

<p>"There you are! Another puzzle! You see, you're curious
yourself directly, Judith."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I am rather," Judith confessed, laughing.</p>

<p>"I think He said it about Her&mdash;when she wasn't," Arthur
maintained.</p>

<p>"I think She said it about herself," urged Judith. "Oh,
of course, she wasn't&mdash;there can't be any doubt about
that."</p>

<p>So Judith thought well of the title&mdash;evidently she did.
Arthur's approval was fortified and grew with contemplation.</p>

<p>"It's corking!" he declared. "And if only Ayesha
Layard's half as good as Joe thinks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If only who's half as good as&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Ayesha Layard&mdash;that's our star, our leading lady. A
discovery of Joe's; he's wild about her."</p>

<p>"I wonder who invented her name, if you come to that!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'll hope for the best," said Arthur, laughing. "I
shall be up a tree, if it goes wrong."</p>

<p>"Not a bad thing to be up a tree sometimes; you get a
good view all round."</p>

<p>"Sagacious philosopher! But I can't afford to lose my
money."</p>

<p>"Let's see, how much were you silly enough&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"One&mdash;thousand&mdash;pounds. No less! I can't really quite
make out how I came to do it."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can't help you there, Arthur. I wasn't in your
confidence."</p>

<p>"Never mind! In for it now! I shall get hold of Joe for
lunch on my way through town, and hear all about it."</p>

<p>"You might look in at the Temple too, and see how many
briefs you've missed!"</p>

<p>"Well, it's vacation, you know&mdash;Still I mean to settle down
to that when I get back from Malvern."</p>

<p>"Yes, you must. We mustn't keep you any longer. You've
been very good to stay&mdash;and it's been very good to have you
here, Arthur."</p>

<p>"By Jove, when I think of what I expected my visit here
to be, and what it has been!"</p>

<p>She shook her head at him with a smile. "Then don't
think of it," she counselled. "Think of <i>Did You Say Mrs.?</i>
instead!"</p>

<p>The parting from Hilsey could not be achieved without
some retrospects, some drawing of contrasts, without memories
bitter or seductive; that would have demanded a mind too
stoical. Yet his leave-taking was graced and softened by
their reluctance to let him go. He went not as a guest whose
sojourn under a strange roof is finished and who may chance
not to pass that way again; his going was rather as that of a
son of the house who sallies forth on his business or his ventures
and, God willing, shall come again, bringing his sheaves
with him, to a home ever and gladly open. So they all, in
their ways, tried to tell him or to show him. For their sakes,
no less than for the dear sake of her who was gone, his heart
was full.</p>

<p>Joe Halliday bustled in to lunch at the appointed meeting-place
as busy and sanguine as ever&mdash;so busy indeed that he
appeared not to have been able to see much of <i>Did You Say
Mrs.?</i> lately. "But it's going on all right," he added reassuringly.
"We had a job over that third act, but it's topping
now. Claud had an idea that Langley liked at last, thank
heaven! It's a job to keep those two chaps from cutting one
another's throats&mdash;that's the only trouble. I expect they'll
be rehearsing this afternoon. Would you like to drop in for
a bit?"</p>

<p>"Love it! I've never seen a rehearsal, and this'll be
thrilling! My train isn't till 4.45."</p>

<p>"Ayesha's divine! Look here, you mustn't make love to
her. I'm doing that myself. I mean I'm trying. That's as
far as I've got." He laughed good-humouredly, devouring
rump-steak at a ruinous rate.</p>

<p>"How's everybody, Joe? How are the Sarradets?"</p>

<p>"I saw the old man only yesterday. He's in great form&mdash;so
cockahoop about this company of his that I believe he's
taken on a new lease of life."</p>

<p>"What company? I haven't heard about it."</p>

<p>"Haven't you? Why, he's turned his business into a
company&mdash;mainly to stop our young friend Raymond from
playing ducks and drakes with it, when his turn comes. It's
a private company&mdash;no public issue of shares. A few debentures
for his friends&mdash;I've been looking after that side of it
for him a bit. Like some?"</p>

<p>"Thanks, but just at present I'm not supporting the investment
market," smiled Arthur.</p>

<p>"Will be soon! So will all of us. Yes, it's all fixed&mdash;and
that lucky devil Sidney Barslow steps in as Managing Director.
He's done himself pretty well all round, has Sidney!"</p>

<p>"He seems to have. Is he all right?" Arthur's comment
and question were both so devoid of interest that Joe stared
at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"I say, don't you know? Didn't anybody write and tell
you? Didn't she write? Marie, I mean. She's engaged to
Sidney. Do you mean to say you didn't know that?"</p>

<p>"No, nobody told me. I've been away, you see." He
paused a moment. "Rather sudden, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, when a stone once begins to roll down hill&mdash;!"
said Joe, with a knowing grin. "Besides he'd been very
useful to them over Raymond. The old man took no end of a
fancy to him. I imagine it all somehow worked in together.
Funny she didn't write and tell you about it!"</p>

<p>Arthur felt that his companion was regarding him with some
curiosity; the friendship between Marie Sarradet and himself
had been so well known in the circle; whether it would become
anything more had doubtless been a matter of speculation
among them. He did not mind Joe's curiosity; better
that it should be turned on this matter than on his more
recent experiences.</p>

<p>"I suppose she had something considerably more pressing
to think about," he remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>Yet the news caused not indeed resentment or jealousy,
but a vague annoyance, based partly on vanity&mdash;the engagement
was sudden, the deeper memories of another attachment
must have faded quickly&mdash;but mainly on regret for Marie. He
could not help feeling that she was throwing herself away on
a partner beneath her, unworthy of her&mdash;from family reasons
in some measure probably, or just for want of anybody better.
The Marie he had known&mdash;that side of her which her shrewd
and affectionate diplomacy had always contrived to present
to the eyes whose scrutiny she feared&mdash;the Marie whom once
he had marked for his&mdash;surely she could not easily mate with
Sidney Barslow, for all the good there was in him? He forgot
that there might be another Marie whom he did not know so
well, perhaps in the end a more real, a more natural, a preponderating
one. He should not have forgotten that possibility,
since there had proved to be more than one Bernadette!</p>

<p>"Well, I hope they'll be very happy. I must go and see
her when I'm back in town."</p>

<p>"They'll do all right," Joe pronounced. "Sidney has
taken a reef in&mdash;several, in fact. He'll have a big chance at
old Sarradet's place and, if I know him, he'll use it."</p>

<p>"And how's Raymond going on?"</p>

<p>"Raymond's on appro., so to speak, both as to the business
and in another quarter, I think. Our pretty Amabel is waiting
to see how he sticks to the blue ribbon of a blameless life.
The old set's rather gone to pot, hasn't it, Arthur? The way
of the world, what?"</p>

<p>"By Jove, it is!" sighed Arthur. Things had a way of
going to pot&mdash;with a vengeance.</p>

<p>The two philosophers finished their pints of beer, and set
out for the Burlington Theatre; upon entering which they shed
their philosophic character and became excited adventurers.</p>

<p>Mr. Langley Etheringham was taking the company through
the first act; they were in the middle of it when Joe, having
piloted Arthur through dark and dirty ways, deposited him in
the third row of the stalls. The well-known "producer"
was a shortish man with a bald head, a red moustache, and
fiery eyes. He was an embodiment of perpetual motion. He
kept on moving his arms from the level of his thighs to that
of his head, as though he were lifting a heavy weight in his
hands, and accompanied the action by a constant quick murmur
of "Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!" He broke off
once or twice to observe sadly, "Not a funeral, my boy, not
a funeral!" but he was soon back at his weight-lifting again.</p>

<p>"Langley's a great believer in pace, especially in the first
act," Joe whispered. Arthur nodded sagaciously. Mr. Etheringham
fascinated him; he could have watched him contentedly
for a long while, as one can watch the untiring and
incredibly swift action of some machine. But nobody on the
stage seemed to take much notice. Some were reading their
parts all the time, some were trying to do without their written
parts. The leading man&mdash;a tall, stout, grey-haired man in
double eyeglasses&mdash;just mumbled his words indifferently, but
was terribly anxious about his "crosses." "Where's my
cross?" "Is this my cross?" "I crossed here this morning."
"I don't like this cross, Langley." His life seemed compact
of crosses.</p>

<p>Arthur could not gather much of what the first act was
about; he had missed the "exposition"&mdash;so at least Joe
informed him; the confusion was to an inexperienced eye
considerable, the dialogue hard to hear owing to Mr. Etheringham's
exhortations and the leading man's crosses. But he
did not mind much; he was keenly interested in the scene
and the people. It did, however, appear that the four characters
now taking part in the action were expecting a fifth, a
woman, and that her entrance was to be the turning-point of
the act. Mr. Etheringham varied his appeal. "Keep it up,
keep it up, keep it up!" he implored. "Keep it up for her,
Willie, keep it <i>Up</i>!" He waved his hands furiously, then
brought them suddenly to rest, stretched out on each side of
him. "<i>Now!</i>"</p>

<p>Everybody was still; even the leading man did not want to
cross.</p>

<p>Miss Ayesha Layard entered. It was evidently a great
moment. The others stiffened in the rigidity of surprise.
Miss Layard looked round, smiling. The leading man began
to mumble. Mr. Etheringham peremptorily stopped him.
"Hold it, Willie, hold it&mdash;I told you to hold it, man! It'll
stand another five seconds!" With poised hands he held
them planted and speechless. "Now!"</p>

<p>Joe heaved a sigh. "Pretty good, don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said Arthur. "I suppose she's really somebody
else, or&mdash;or they think she is?"</p>

<p>"Ought to be, anyhow," Joe whispered back with a cunning
smile.</p>

<p>Miss Ayesha Layard was a small lady, very richly dressed.
She had a turned-up nose, wide-open blue eyes, and an expression
of intense innocence. She did not look more than seventeen,
and no doubt could look even younger when required.
In one hand she held the script of her part, in the other a large
sandwich with a bite out of it; and she was munching.</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Mr. Etheringham, suddenly spying the
sandwich, "I will not go on while you're eating!"</p>

<p>"But I'm so hungry, Mr. Etheringham!" she pleaded in a
sweet childish voice. "It's past three and I've had no lunch."</p>

<p>"Lunch, lunch, always lunch! No sooner do we begin to
get going than it's lunch!"</p>

<p>She stood still, munching, smiling, appealing to him with
wide-open candid eyes. He flung himself crossly into a chair.
"Take a quarter-of-an-hour then! After that we'll go back
and run straight through the act." Miss Layard dimpled in
a smile. He broke out again. "But go on while you're eating
I won't!"</p>

<p>On receiving their brief respite the men on the stage had
scuttled off, like rabbits into their holes; Miss Layard too
hurried off, but soon reappeared in the front of the house,
carrying a paper bag with more sandwiches. She sat down
in the front row of the stalls, still munching steadily.</p>

<p>"I'll be back in a minute," said Joe, and went and sat
himself down beside her.</p>

<p>A melancholy voice came from the cavernous recesses of
the pit: "We could do with a bit more life, Etheringham."</p>

<p>"If we get the pace and the positions now, the life'll soon
come. I've got some experience, I suppose, haven't I?"</p>

<p>The author emerged into view, as he replied sadly, "Oh,
experience, yes!" He did not appear disposed to allow the
producer any other qualifications for his task.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheringham gave him a fiery glare but no answer.
Mr. Beverley saw Arthur and came up to him. "Hullo, Lisle,
have you come to see this rot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I'm afraid I can't stay. I've a train to catch,
and I've got to get my hair cut first."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you won't miss much," said Beverley resignedly,
as he dropped into the next stall.</p>

<p>Arthur was surprised at his mode of referring to the great
work; his attitude had been different that night at the Sarradets',
when they celebrated the formation of the Syndicate.
Perhaps the author detected his feeling, for he went on:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right of its sort. It's funny, you know, all
right&mdash;it'll go. Etheringham there swears by it, and he's a
pretty good judge, in spite of his crankiness. But&mdash;well, I've
moved on since I wrote it. Life has begun to interest me&mdash;real
life, I mean, and real people, and the way things really happen.
I'm writing a play now about a woman leaving her husband
and children. I hope the Twentieth Society'll do it. Well, I
treat it like a thing that really happens, not as you see it done
on the stage or in novels."</p>

<p>Arthur was curious. "How do you make her do it?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Why, in a reasonable way&mdash;openly, after discussing the
matter, as real men and women would. None of the old elopement
nonsense! Real people don't do that."</p>

<p>"Well, but&mdash;er&mdash;don't people differ?"</p>

<p>"Not half so much as you think&mdash;not real people. Well,
you'll see. Only I wish I could get on a bit quicker. The
office takes up so much of my time. If I can make a bit out
of this thing, I'll chuck the office." He paused for a minute.
"You've been away, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've been down in the country. Had some family
affairs to&mdash;er&mdash;look after." He was a little surprised that
Mr. Beverley had condescended to notice his absence.</p>

<p>"Going to be in town now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm off for about ten days more. Then I've got to
buckle to work&mdash;if I can get any work to buckle to, that is."</p>

<p>Mr. Beverley nodded thoughtfully and smiled. The next
moment a loud giggling proceeded from where Miss Layard and
Joe sat. The lady rose, saying, "I'll ask Mr. Beverley," and
came towards them, Joe looking on with a broad grin on his
face. "He's not like you&mdash;he's sensible and serious." After
a quick glance over her shoulder at Joe, she addressed the
author. "Oh, Mr. Beverley, you're a literary man and all
that. Tell me, do you say 'ee-ther' or 'eye-ther'?" Her
face was a picture of innocent gravity.</p>

<p>"Eye-ther," replied the eminent author promptly.</p>

<p>"But which?"</p>

<p>"Eye-ther."</p>

<p>"Oh, but haven't you a choice?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I say 'eye-ther,' Miss Layard."</p>

<p>Joe sniggered. Arthur began to smile slowly, as the joke
dawned upon him.</p>

<p>"Just as it happens&mdash;or alternately&mdash;or on Sundays and
week-days, or what, Mr. Beverley?"</p>

<p>"I've told you three times already that I say&mdash;&mdash;" He
stopped, looked at her sourly, and fell back in his stall, muttering
something that sounded very like "Damned nonsense!"</p>

<p>"I thought I could pull your leg!" she cried exultantly,
and burst into the merriest peal of laughter&mdash;sweet ringing
laughter that set Arthur laughing too in sympathy. She was
indeed all that Joe had said when she laughed like that. She
was irresistible. If only Mr. Beverley had given her opportunity
enough for laughter, <i>Did you Say Mrs.?</i> must surely
be a success!</p>

<p>She saw his eyes fixed on her in delight. "Awfully good,
isn't it?" she said. "Because you can't get out of it, whatever
you answer!" Her laughter trilled out again, clear,
rich, and soft.</p>

<p>"First Act!" called Mr. Etheringham threateningly.</p>

<p>"I'd like to try it on him," she whispered. "Only he's so
cross!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

<h2>THE OLD DAYS END</h2>


<p>Arthur was an affectionate son and enjoyed going
home, yet on this occasion he approached his
destination with some uneasiness. Mrs. Lisle was
a religious woman, Anna was even more strictly devout;
they both professed High Church principles, and though
frail health had compelled the mother to give up practical
good works the daughter was busily engaged in them. They
had lived out of the large world all their lives. Their standards
and point of view had none of the easiness and laxity of
London drawing-rooms and London clubs. They were not
at all modern. Arthur smiled over the thought that Mr.
Claud Beverley would probably decline to consider them real,
but he did not smile at the prospect of discussing with them
the catastrophe of Hilsey. He had broken the terrible news
by letter; that was better than announcing it in person and
encountering the full force of dismay and reprobation which
it must provoke. He had also added; "It is very painful to
talk of it and can do no good. Let us forget it when we
meet"; but he was extremely doubtful whether this hint
would have any effect. Horror does not, unfortunately,
preclude curiosity.</p>

<p>At first, however, there was no thought or talk of the sin
or the sinner. They had a great piece of news for him, which
they had saved up to tell him themselves; they would not
waste it on a letter. Anna had become engaged to be married
to Ronald Slingsby, the curate of the parish. Another
surprise of this kind for Arthur! But here he was unreservedly
delighted, and the more so because he had hardly
expected that Anna would take, or perhaps would find, a
husband; she had always seemed aloof from that sort of
thing, too deeply immersed in her pious activities. It was
rather strange to see austere Anna stand blushing&mdash;actually
blushing&mdash;by the chair where the frail grey-haired mother
sat, and talking about "Ronald" with shy pride and happiness.
Ronald had been a fellow-Malvernian of his, and
Arthur did not privately think much of him&mdash;No need, of
course, to say that!</p>

<p>"And he's just devoted to her," said Mrs. Lisle. "Oh,
yes, he is, Anna dear! He told us that at first he had scruples
about marrying, as he was a priest, but he felt that this great
feeling must have been given him for a purpose, and so his
conscience became quite reconciled."</p>

<p>"I don't think he would ever have cared for anybody who
wasn't interested in his work and couldn't help him in it,"
Anna added.</p>

<p>"I'd have betted he'd reconcile his conscience all right,"
smiled Arthur.</p>

<p>"My dear boy, you mustn't be flippant," said his mother
in gentle reproof. "I'm very very happy," she went on, "to
have Anna settled with a man she can love and trust, before
I'm called away; and I'm not nearly as strong as I was.
Last winter tried me very much."</p>

<p>"Her cough gets so bad sometimes," said Anna. "But I
shall be only across the road, and able to look after her just
as well when we're married. Go and get ready for dinner,
Arthur. It's been put back till eight o'clock on your account,
and Ronald is coming."</p>

<p>Ronald came but, owing to its being a Friday, ate no meat;
his betrothed followed his example; bodily weakness excused,
on Mrs. Lisle's part, a slice of the white meat of a chicken,
both of whose legs were dedicated to Arthur's healthy
appetite. Ronald was not a bad-looking fellow, tall, thin,
and muscular; he was decidedly ecclesiastical in demeanour
and bearing&mdash;as well as, of course, in apparel&mdash;and this
betrayed him sometimes into a sort of <i>ex cathedra</i> attitude
which his office might justify but his youth certainly did
not. Remembering him as an untidy urchin full of tricks
only a few years ago, Arthur became a little impatient
of it.</p>

<p>At last Mrs. Lisle bethought her of Hilsey. "And how did
you leave the poor people?" she asked gently. "You
needn't mind speaking before Ronald; he's one of the family
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, really, they're&mdash;er&mdash;bearing up pretty well, mother.
It's a bad job, of course, a great shock, and all that, but&mdash;well,
things'll settle down, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Has anything been heard of the unfortunate woman?"
Mrs. Lisle went on.</p>

<p>Arthur did not like the phrase; he flushed a little.
"They're abroad, mother. She'll naturally stay there, I
should think, till matters are adjusted."</p>

<p>"Adjusted, Arthur?" Anna's request for an interpretation
sounded a note of surprise.</p>

<p>"Till after the divorce, I mean."</p>

<p>"Does your cousin intend to apply for a divorce?" asked
the happy suitor.</p>

<p>"Bernadette wants one, and he's ready to do anything
she wishes."</p>

<p>A long pause fell upon the company&mdash;evidently a hostile
pause.</p>

<p>"And will the other man go through a form of marriage
with her?" asked Ronald.</p>

<p>"Of course he'll marry her. To do Oliver Wyse justice,
we needn't be afraid about that."</p>

<p>"Afraid!" Anna exclaimed very low. Mrs. Lisle shook
her grey head sadly. "Unhappy creature!" she murmured.</p>

<p>Arthur had been bred in this atmosphere, but coming back
to it now he found it strange and unfamiliar. Different from
the air of London, profoundly different from the air of Hilsey
itself! There they had never thought of Bernadette as an
unfortunate woman or an unhappy creature. Their attitude
towards her had been quite different. As for his own part in
the transaction&mdash;well, it was almost amusing to think what
would happen at home if the truth of it were told. He had
a mischievous impulse to tell Ronald&mdash;but, no, he must not
risk its getting to his mother's ears.</p>

<p>"And they're abroad together!" mused Mrs. Lisle.</p>

<p>"They're on his yacht&mdash;so the lawyers said&mdash;somewhere
in the Mediterranean."</p>

<p>"How can they?" Anna speculated.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately we must remember that people are capable
of a great many things which we cannot understand," said
Ronald.</p>

<p>"Her conscience can give the poor thing no peace, I should
think." Again Mrs. Lisle shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"You mustn't think hardly of Bernadette, mother. It&mdash;it wasn't
altogether her fault that she and Godfrey didn't
hit it off. He knows that, I think, himself. I'm sure he'd
say so. She had her difficulties and&mdash;er&mdash;trials."</p>

<p>"Most married women have, my dear, but that's no reason
for deserting their husbands and children, and committing
the sin that she has committed&mdash;and is committing."</p>

<p>"If this unhappy person&mdash;&mdash;" Ronald began.</p>

<p>Arthur might stand it from his mother; he could not
from Ronald Slingsby. "If you've nothing pleasant to call
people, Slingsby, you might just call them by their names.
Bernadette has been a dear good friend to me, and I don't
like the phrase you choose to describe her. And I must say,
mother, that if you knew the circumstances as well as I do,
you'd be more charitable."</p>

<p>"I'm as sorry&mdash;as bitterly sorry&mdash;as I can be, dear,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's more a question of justice than of sorrow."</p>

<p>"Well, how have we been unjust, Arthur?" This question
of Anna's was plainly hostile.</p>

<p>"You don't allow for circumstances and&mdash;and temptations,
and&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off impatiently. "It's really not much
good trying to explain."</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to be sorry I ever persuaded you to make
their acquaintance," sighed Mrs. Lisle.</p>

<p>Anna's hostility and Ronald Slingsby's prim commiseration
annoyed Arthur exceedingly. His mother's attitude
towards him touched him more deeply, and to a half-amused
yet sincere remorse. It grew more marked with every day of
his visit. She showed an affectionate but rather reproachful
anxiety about him&mdash;about his life, his doings, and his ways
of thought. She seemed to fear&mdash;indeed she hinted&mdash;that
his association with the Lisles (which meant, of course, with
Bernadette, and for which she persisted in shouldering a
responsibility not really belonging to her) might have sapped
his morals and induced a laxity in his principles and perhaps&mdash;if
only she knew all&mdash;in his conduct. She evinced a gentle
yet persistent curiosity about his work, about his companions
and his pursuits in London. She abounded in references to
the hopes and anxieties entertained about him by his father;
she would add that she knew, understood, and allowed for
the temptations of young men; there was the more need to
seek strength where alone strength could be found.</p>

<p>Arthur tried hard to banish the element of amusement
from his remorse. Although his behaviour in London might
stand comparison pretty well with that of many young men
of his age and class, yet he was really guilty on all counts of
the indictment, and had so found himself by his own verdict
before now. He had neglected his work, squandered his
money, and declared himself the lover of his cousin's wife.
He was as great a sinner, then, as the unfortunate woman
herself! It was a bad record, thus baldly summarised. But
what, in the end, had that bald summary to do with the
true facts of the case, with the way in which things had been
induced and had come about? In what conceivable relation,
in how remote a degree of verisimilitude, did it stand towards
the actual history of those London and Hilsey days? Accept
condemnation as he might, his mind pleaded at least for
understanding. And the dear frail old woman said she
understood!</p>

<p>Moreover&mdash;and it is an unlucky thing for weak human
nature&mdash;moral causes and spiritual appeals are apt, by force
of accident or circumstances, to get identified with and, as
it were, embodied in personalities which are not sympathetic;
they pay the penalty. His mother's anxious affection would
have fared better, had Anna not stood so uncompromisingly
for propriety of conduct, and Ronald Slingsby for the sanctity
of the marriage bond. The pair&mdash;to Arthur they seemed
already one mind, though not yet one flesh, and he secretly
charged Ronald with setting his sister against him&mdash;were to
him, in plain language, prigs; they applied their principles
without the modifications demanded by common sense, and
their formulas without allowance for facts; they passed the
same sentence on all offenders of whatever degree of guilt.
And yet, after all, as soon as Ronald wanted to marry, he had
"reconciled his conscience" without much apparent difficulty!
Lack of charity in them bred the like in him. When
they cried "Sinners!" he retorted "Pharisees!" and
stiffened his neck even against what was true in their accusation.</p>

<p>But in the end his mother's love, and perhaps still more
her weakness, won its way with him. He achieved, in some
degree at least, the difficult task of looking through her eyes,
of realising all the years of care and devotion, all the burden
of hopes and fears, which had gone towards setting his feet
upon the path of life; all that had been put into the making
of him, and had rendered it possible for him to complete the
work himself. He could not be as she, in her fond heart,
would have him, a child still and always, unspotted from the
world, nay, untouched, unformed by it; but he could be
something worth being; he could make a return, albeit not
the return she asked for. He renewed to her the promises
he had made to himself; he would work, he would be prudent,
he would order his ways. He took her small thin hand in his
and patted it reassuringly, as he sat on a stool by the side of
her arm-chair. "I'll be all I haven't been, mother! Still
I believe I've learnt a thing or two."</p>

<p>Hardest thing of all, he opened his heart a little&mdash;not all
the way&mdash;about the sinner, about Bernadette.</p>

<p>"If you had known her, mother! It was cruel bad luck
for her! She just had to have just what poor old Godfrey
hasn't got. Oh, I know all you say but it is much harder
for some people than for others. Now isn't it? And to me
I can't tell you what she was. If she wants me, I've always
got to be a friend to her."</p>

<p>"You were very fond of her, poor boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. She was so full of kindness, and life, and
gaiety, and so beautiful."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!" she said again very softly. She understood
something of his adoration; it was as much as it was well
for her to know. "We must pray that God, in His good time,
will turn her gifts to good uses. Tell me about the others&mdash;poor
Godfrey, and the little girl, and Judith Arden."</p>

<p>She listened gladly while he told her of Hilsey and how
he loved the place, how they all liked him to be there, and
of his hope that peace, if not joy, might now be the portion
of that house.</p>

<p>"It will be another home to you, and you'll need one soon,
I think." He pressed her hand again. "No, my dear, I'm
ready. I used to think Anna would make her home with
you in London when I was gone, but that won't be now."
She sighed. "Better not perhaps! She's at home here, and
it mightn't have worked." Another sigh marked her resigned
sorrow at the strange differences there were between children.
"And her home here&mdash;well, it won't be quite the same as
home to you, will it?"</p>

<p>Most decidedly not&mdash;Ronald Slingsby's house! Arthur
could reply only by another squeeze of her hand and a ruefully
deprecating smile.</p>

<p>"And some day you'll have a wife and a home of your
own." Her mind travelled back to his earlier letters. "What's
become of that nice girl you told me about&mdash;Miss Sarradet?"</p>

<p>"I've just heard that she's engaged to be married. She
didn't wait for me, mother!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, they were very nice people, I know, but
hardly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not quite up to the Lisles of Hilsey, you mean?" he
asked, laughing. "Worldly pride!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, since she's engaged&mdash;&mdash;" Mrs. Lisle was
evidently a little relieved. How near the peril once had been
Arthur did not tell her.</p>

<p>"Work now&mdash;not wives!" he said gaily. "I want to
show you a whacking big brief, before many months are over.
Still, don't expect it too confidently."</p>

<p>"Keep friends with your sister. Keep friends with
Ronald," she enjoined him. "I don't think he'll rise to
distinction in the Church, but he's a good man, Arthur."</p>

<p>"When I'm Lord Chancellor, mother, I'll give him a fat
living!"</p>

<p>"You've grown into a fine man, Arthur. You're handsomer
than your father was." The gentle voice had grown drowsy
and low. He saw that she was falling into a doze&mdash;perhaps
with a vision of her own youth before her eyes. He did not
disengage his hand from hers until she slept.</p>

<p>Thus he came nearer to his mother, and for the sake and
remembrance of that blessed his visit home. But to Anna
and her future husband any approach was far more difficult.
There he seemed met by an obstinate incompatibility.
Ronald's outlook, which now governed and bounded Anna's,
was entirely professional&mdash;with one subject excepted. He
was an enthusiast about football. He had been a great
player, and Arthur a good one. They fought old battles
over again, or recited to one another the deeds of heroes.
There are men who, when they meet, always talk about the
same subject, because it is the only thing they have in common,
and it acts as a bridge between them. Whenever a
topic became dangerous, Arthur changed it for football.
Football saved the situation between them a hundred times.</p>

<p>"I really never knew how tremendously Ronald was
interested in it, till you came this time, Arthur," Anna
remarked innocently. "I suppose he thought I wasn't
worth talking to about it."</p>

<p>"Of course you weren't, my dear," said Arthur. "What
woman is?" He smiled slyly over his successful diplomacy.</p>

<p>But though football may be a useful buffer against collisions
of faith and morals, and may even draw hearts together
for a season in common humanity, it can hardly form the
cement of a home. His mother was right. When once she
was gone&mdash;and none dared hope long life for her&mdash;there
would be no home for him in the place of his youth. As he
walked over the hills, on the day before he was to return to
London, he looked on the prospect with the eye of one who
takes farewell. His life henceforth lay elsewhere. The
chapter of boyhood and adolescence drew to its close. The
last tie that bound him to those days grew slack and would
soon give way. He had no more part or lot in this place.</p>

<p>Save for the love of that weak hand which would fain have
detained him, but for his own sake beckoned him to go, he
was eager to depart. He craved again the fulness of life and
activity. He wanted to be at work&mdash;to try again and make
a better job of it.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall make an ass of myself again and again,
but at any rate I'll work," he said, and put behind him the
mocking memory of Henry encountering the Law Reports
in full career. <i>Retro Satanas!</i> He would work&mdash;even though
the farce succeeded!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

<h2>RATHER ROMANTIC!</h2>


<p>Marie Sarradet's decision had been hastened
by a train of events and circumstances which might
have been devised expressly to precipitate the issue.
The chain started with a letter from Mrs. Veltheim, in which
the good lady announced her intention of paying her brother
a visit. Mr. Sarradet was nothing loth; he was still poorly,
and thought his sister's company and conversation would
cheer him up. Marie took a radically opposite view. She
knew Aunt Louisa! A persevering bloodhound she was!
Once her nose was on the trail, she never gave up. Her nose
had scented Arthur Lisle's attentions; she would want to
know what had become of them and of him&mdash;when, and why,
and whither they had taken themselves off. The question
arose then&mdash;how to evade Aunt Louisa?</p>

<p>It was answered pat&mdash;fortune favours the brave, and
Sidney Barslow was, both in love and in war, audacious&mdash;by
a letter from that gentleman. For ten days he and Raymond
had walked hard from place to place. Now they proposed to
make their headquarters at Bettws-y-Coed for the rest of
the trip. "It's done Raymond simply no end of good. He'll
be another man by the time we come back. You must want
a change too! Why not come down and join us for ten days,
and see if Amabel won't come with you? I believe she would.
We'd have a rare time&mdash;Snowdon, and Beddgelert, and the
Hound, and all the rest of it. This is a very romantic spot, with
a picturesque stream and surrounded by luxuriantly wooded
cliffs and hills&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hullo! That was odd from Sidney Barslow, and must have
cost him no small effort!</p>

<p>Marie smiled over the effusion. "Oh, he got it out of the
guide-book!" she reflected. But it was very significant of
what Sidney thought appropriate to his situation.</p>

<p>She mentioned the plan to the old man. He was eager in
its favour. The more his own vigour waned, the more he held
out his arms to the strong man who had saved his son and who
seemed sent by heaven to save his business. To him he would
give his daughter with joy and confidence. That the great
end of marriages was to help family fortunes was an idea no
less deeply enrooted in his <i>bourgeois</i> blood than in the august
veins of the House of Austria itself. In favouring a match
with Arthur Lisle he had not departed from it; at that time
the only thing the family had seemed to lack was gentility&mdash;which
Arthur would supply. But what was gentility beside
solvency? He had been compelled to sell securities! He was
all for a man of business now.</p>

<p>"Go, my dear, and take Amabel with you, if she'll go. I'll
stand treat for both of you."</p>

<p>In spite of those vanished securities! "Pops is keen!"
thought Marie, smiling to herself.</p>

<p>And naturally Miss Amabel, though she was careful to
convey that the jaunt committed her to nothing, was not
going to refuse a free holiday combined with a situation of
some romantic interest: not too many of either came her way
in life!</p>

<p>Off the girls went, full of glee, and a fine time they had.
They found the young men bronzed to a masculine comeliness,
teeming with masculine vigour, pleasantly arrogant over the
physical strength of the male animal. Little Raymond
strutted like a bantam cock. Where was the trembling nerveless
creature whom Sidney Barslow had brought back to
Regent's Park? Sidney himself was magnificent&mdash;like a hunter
in prime condition; his flesh all turned to muscle, and his
bold eager eyes clear as a child's. What a leader of their
expeditions! "Take the train up Snowdon? Not much!
I'll carry anybody who gets tired!" he laughed, and in very
truth he could have done it. A mighty fellow, glorying in
the strong life within him!</p>

<p>He seemed splendid to Amabel. How should he not? Here
was a man worthy of her dearly admired Marie. Raymond
was privy to his hopes and favoured them, first from admiration
and gratitude, next because he knew his father's purpose,
and had his own pride to save. He was not to be left in charge
of the business. To be postponed to a stranger in blood would
be a slur on him in the eyes of his friends and of the staff. But
to a brother-in-law, his senior in age and experience&mdash;that
would not be half so bad! Besides he honestly wished to keep
his preserver at hand in case of need, ready to save him again
on occasion; and he was shrewd enough to discern why
Sidney had taken so much pains over his salvation. Father,
friend, and brother were all of one mind. A chorus of joy and
congratulation, of praises for her wisdom, awaited Marie's
decision, if it were the right one. In the other event, the best
to be hoped for was that affection should hide, more or less
completely, a bitter disappointment, an unuttered charge of
indifference to the wishes and the interests of those she loved.</p>

<p>Here were valuable allies for Sidney, for in Marie too the
sense of family solidarity was strong. The Welsh trip came as
an added godsend to him, showing him to the greatest advantage,
setting her being astir and shaking her out of her staidness.
But in the end he owed most to his resolution and his
confidence, to the very simplicity of his view of the matter.
How could a fine girl like her refuse a fine man like him?
When it came to the point&mdash;as soon it should&mdash;surely she
couldn't do it! She smiled, she was amused, she teased him;
but her secret visions were always of surrender and acceptance
and, following on them, of a great peace, a transfer of all her
cares and troubles to shoulders infinitely powerful.</p>

<p>He thought her romantic; he chose for his moment a moonlight
evening, for his scene the old bridge&mdash;the Pont-y-Pair.
He led her there after dinner, two nights before they were to
go back to London. She guessed his purpose; his air was one
of determination. She stood looking down into the water,
intensely conscious of his presence, though for some minutes
he smoked in silence. Indeed the whole place seemed full of
his masterful personality; she grew a little afraid. He
knocked out his pipe on the parapet of the bridge; some
glowing ashes twinkled down to the water and were quenched.
She felt her heart beat quick as he put the pipe in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Marie!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Come, won't you even look at me?"</p>

<p>She had no power to disobey; she turned her face slowly
towards his, though otherwise she did not move.</p>

<p>"Do you like me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I like you, Sidney. You know that."</p>

<p>"Anything more?" Her hands were clasped in front of
her, resting on the parapet. He put out his great right hand
and covered them. "I love you, Marie. I want you to be
my wife."</p>

<p>She turned her face away again; she was trembling, not
with fear, but with excitement. She felt his arm about her
waist. Then she heard his voice in a low exultant whisper,
"You love me, Marie!" It was not a question. She leant
back against the strong arm that encircled her. Then his kiss
was on her lips.</p>

<p>"But I've never even said 'yes,'" she protested, trembling
and laughing.</p>

<p>"I'm saying it for you," he answered in jovial triumph.</p>

<p>"Take me back to the hotel, please, Sidney," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Not a walk first?" He was disappointed.</p>

<p>"As much as you like to-morrow!"</p>

<p>He yielded and took her back. There she fled from him to
her own room, but came back in half-an-hour, serene and smiling,
to receive praise and embraces from brother and friend.
She had thrown herself on her bed and lain there, on her back,
very still save for her quick breathing, her eyes very bright&mdash;like
a captured animal awaiting what treatment it knows not.
Only by degrees did she recover calm; with it came the peace
of her visions&mdash;the sense of the strong right arm encircling
and shielding her. The idea that she could ever of her own
will, aye, or of her own strength, thrust it away seemed now
impossible. If ever woman in the world had a fate foreordained,
hers was here!</p>

<p>But Sidney had no thought of fate. By his own right hand
and his powerful arm he had gained the victory.</p>

<p>"If you'd told me three or four months ago that I should
bring this off, I'd never have believed you," he told Raymond
as they rejoiced together over whisky-and-soda, the first they
had allowed themselves since they started on the trip. "Never
say die! That's the moral. I thought I was done once,
though." He screwed up his mouth over the recollection of
that quarrel at the tennis courts. "But I got back again all
right. It just shows!"</p>

<p>He forgot wherein he was most indebted to fortune, as his
present companion might have reminded him. But strong
men treat fortune as they treat their fellow-creatures; they
use her to their best advantage and take to themselves the
credit. The admiring world is content to have it so, and
Raymond Sarradet was well content.</p>

<p>"I did think she had a bit of a fancy for that chap Arthur
Lisle once," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought so too. But, looking back, I don't believe
it." He smiled the smile of knowledge and experience. "The
best of girls have their little tricks, Raymond, my boy! I
don't believe she had, but I fancy she didn't mind my thinking
that she had. Do you twig what I mean, old fellow?"</p>

<p>This reading of the past in the light of the present commended
itself to both of them.</p>

<p>"Oh, they want tackling, that's what they want!" Sidney
told his admiring young companion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The girls shared a room, and upstairs Amabel was chirping
round Marie's bed, perching on it, hopping off it, twittering
like an excited canary. What would everybody say&mdash;Mr.
Sarradet, Mildred, Joe Halliday? The event was calculated to
stir even the Olympian melancholy of Claud Beverley! Here
too there was an echo of the past&mdash;"And Mr. Arthur Lisle
can put it in his pipe and smoke it!" she ended, rather
viciously. Her loyalty to Marie had never forgiven Arthur for
his back-sliding.</p>

<p>"You silly!" said Marie in indulgent reproof. "As if Mr.
Lisle would care! He thinks of nobody but his cousin&mdash;Mrs.
Godfrey Lisle, I mean, you know."</p>

<p>"He did think about somebody else once," nodded Amabel.
"Oh, you can't tell me, Marie! But I suppose Mrs. Lisle
has turned his head. Well, she is sweetly pretty, and very
nice."</p>

<p>"I expect he's quite as fond of her as he ought to be, at all
events," smiled Marie.</p>

<p>"Rather romantic, isn't it? Like Paolo! Don't you
remember how lovely Paolo was?"</p>

<p>"But Mr. Lisle isn't a bit like that. Still, nobody could
have a chance against her." Marie's tone was impartial,
impersonal, not at all resentful. Sidney Barslow's triumphant
march swept all obstacles from his path, even the guerilla
attack of insurgent memories. They could not cause delay or
loss; the sputter of their harmless fire rather added a zest.
"He was very attractive in his way," she reflected with a
smile. "And I really do believe&mdash;no, I musn't tell you!"</p>

<p>And in the end she did not. She had, however, said enough
to account for Amabel's exclamation of "Well, it's a blessing
you didn't! I like Arthur Lisle, but to compare him with
Sidney!"</p>

<p>"I've got what I want, anyhow," said Marie, with a luxurious
nestling-down on her pillow. "How are you and
Raymond getting on?" she added with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Marie, as if I should think of it, as if I should let him say
a word, oh, for ever so long! One can't be too careful!"</p>

<p>"But you mustn't make too much of it. He was very young
and&mdash;and ignorant."</p>

<p>"He's not so ignorant now," Amabel remarked drily.</p>

<p>"Sidney'll keep him in order. You may depend upon that.
You see, he can't fool Sidney. He knows too much. He'd
know in a minute if Raymond was up to anything."</p>

<p>"Oh, that does make it much safer, of course. Still&mdash;&mdash;"
She broke into a giggle&mdash;"Perhaps he won't want it after all,
Marie!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he will, you goose!" said Marie. And so they
chattered on till the clock struck midnight.</p>

<p>When Arthur, returned from Malvern, came to congratulate
Marie, he found her in a blaze of family glory, the reward of
the girl who has done the wise thing and is content with it,
who, feeling herself happy in wisdom, enables everybody else
to feel comfortable. Old Mr. Sarradet even seemed grateful
to Arthur himself for not having deprived him prematurely
of a daughter who had developed into such a valuable asset,
and been ultimately disposed of to so much greater advantage;
at least some warrant for this impression might be found in
the mixture of extreme friendliness and sly banter with which
he entertained the visitor until Marie made her appearance.
As soon as she came, she managed to get rid of her father very
promptly; she felt instinctively that the triumphant note was
out of place.</p>

<p>Yet she could not hide the great contentment which possessed
her; native sincerity made such concealment impossible.
Arthur saw her enviable state and, while he smiled,
honestly rejoiced. The old sense of comradeship revived in
him; he remembered how much happiness he had owed her.
The last silly remnant of condescending surprise at her choice
vanished.</p>

<p>"It does one good to see you so happy," he declared. "I
bask in the rays, Marie!"</p>

<p>"I hope you'll often come and bask&mdash;afterwards."</p>

<p>"I will, if you'll let me. We must go on being friends. I
want to be better friends with Sidney."</p>

<p>She smiled rather significantly. Arthur laughed. "Oh,
that's all over long ago&mdash;I was an ass! I mean I want really
to know him better."</p>

<p>"He'll be very pleased, though he's still a little afraid of
you, I expect. He has improved very much, you know. He's
so much more&mdash;well, responsible. And think what he's done
for us!"</p>

<p>"I know. Joe told me. And he's going into the business?"</p>

<p>"He's going to be the business, I think," she answered,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Splendid! And here am I, still a waster! I must get
Sidney to reform me too, I think."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. I expect nobody's allowed to
interfere with you!" She smiled roguishly and asked in
banter, "How is the wonderful cousin? You've been staying
with her, haven't you?"</p>

<p>Arthur started; the smile left his face. The question
was like a sudden blow to him. But of course Marie knew
nothing of the disaster; she imagined him to be still happily
and gaily adoring. She would know soon, though&mdash;all the
world would; she would read the hard ugly fact in the papers,
or hear of it in unkind gossip.</p>

<p>"Of course you haven't heard. There's been trouble.
She's left us. She's gone away."</p>

<p>For the first time the Christian name by which she thought
of him passed her lips in her eagerness of sympathy:
"Arthur!"</p>

<p>"Yes, about a month ago now. You remember the man
she was lunching with that day&mdash;Oliver Wyse? He's taken
her away."</p>

<p>"Oh, but how terrible! Forgive me for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to forgive. You couldn't know. But
it'll be common property soon. You&mdash;you mustn't think too
badly of her, Marie."</p>

<p>But Marie came of a stock that holds by the domestic
virtues&mdash;for women, at all events. She said nothing; she
pursed up her lips ominously. Was she too going to talk about
'the unfortunate woman'? No, she was surely too just to
dispose of the matter in that summary fashion! If she understood,
she would do justice. The old desire for her sympathy
revived in him&mdash;for sympathy of mind; he wanted her to look
at the affair as he did. To that end she must know more of
Bernadette, more of Godfrey and of Oliver Wyse&mdash;things
that the world at large would never know, though the circle
of immediate friends might be well enough aware of them.
He tried to hint some of these things to her, in rather halting
phrases about uncongeniality, want of tastes in common, not
'hitting it off,' and so forth. But Marie was not much disposed
to listen. She would not be at pains to understand.
Her concern was for her friend.</p>

<p>"I'm only thinking what it must have meant to you&mdash;what
it must mean," she said. "Because you were so very very
fond of her, weren't you? When did you hear of it?"</p>

<p>"I was in the house when it happened."</p>

<p>Now she listened while he told how Bernadette had gone&mdash;told
all save his own madness.</p>

<p>"And you had to go through that!" Marie murmured.</p>

<p>"I deserved it. I'd made such a fool of myself," he said.</p>

<p>His self-reproach told her enough of his madness; nay, she
read into it even more than the truth.</p>

<p>"How could she let you, when she loved another man all
the time?" she cried.</p>

<p>"She never thought about me in that way for a moment.
And I&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off. He would not tell the exact truth;
but neither would he lie to Marie.</p>

<p>She judged the case in its obvious aspect&mdash;a flirt cruelly
reckless, a young man enticed and deluded.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have believed it of her! You deserve and
you'll get something better than that! Don't waste another
thought on her, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Never mind about me. I want you to see how it happened
that Bernadette could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Bernadette!" Her voice rang in scorn over the name.
"Will nothing cure you?"</p>

<p>He smiled, though ruefully. This was not now cold condemnation
of his old idol; it was a burst of generous indignation
over a friend's wrong. Bernadette's treatment of her
husband, her child, her vows, was no longer in Marie's mind;
it was the usage of her friend. Could the friend be angry at
that?</p>

<p>"Time'll cure me, I suppose&mdash;as much as I want to be
cured," he said. "And you're just the same jolly good friend
you always were, Marie. I came to wish you joy, not to whine
about myself&mdash;only you happened to ask after her, and I
couldn't very well hold my tongue about it. Only do remember
that, whatever others may have, I have no grievance&mdash;no
cause of complaint. Anything that's happened to me I
brought on myself."</p>

<p>No use! He saw that, and smiled hopelessly over it. Marie
was resolved on having him a victim; he had to give in to
her. She had got the idea absolutely fixed in that tenacious
mind of hers. He turned back to the legitimate purpose of
his visit.</p>

<p>"And when is the wedding to be?"</p>

<p>"In about six weeks. You'll come, won't you, Mr. Lisle?"</p>

<p>But Arthur had noticed what she called him, when moved
by sympathy. "Don't go back to that. You called me
'Arthur' just now."</p>

<p>"Did I? I didn't notice. But I shall like to call you Arthur,
if I may." She gave him her hand with the frankest heartiness.
'Arthur' felt himself established in a simple and cordial
friendship; it was not quite the footing on which 'Mr. Lisle'
had stood. Hopes and fears, dreams and sentiment, were
gone from her thoughts of him; a great goodwill was the
residuum.</p>

<p>Perhaps she was generous to give so much, and Arthur
lucky to receive it; and perhaps the news of Bernadette's
misdeeds made the measure of it greater. Whatever might
have been the case previously, it was now plain as day that,
in any respect in which Arthur's past conduct needed excuse,
he had not really been a free agent. He had been under a
delusion, a spell, a wicked domination. Did ever so fair a face
hide such villainy?</p>

<p>The tidings of Arthur's tragedy went forth to the Sarradet
household and the Sarradet circle. Sidney Barslow heard of
it with a decorous sympathy which masked a secret snigger.
Amabel twittered over it, with a new reminiscence of her
Paolo&mdash;only that ended differently! Joe Halliday had strange
phrases in abundance, through which he strove to express a
Byronic recognition of love's joy and woe. He told Miss
Ayesha Layard, and thereby invested handsome Mr. Lisle
with a new romantic interest. The story of the unhappy
passion and its end, the flight in early morning of the guilty
pair, reached even the ears of Mr. Claud Beverley, who
sorrowed as a man that such things should happen, and deplored
as an artist that they should happen in that way.</p>

<p>"There need have been no trouble. Why weren't they
all open and sensible about it?" he demanded of Miss Layard&mdash;very
incautiously.</p>

<p>"Because there's a B in both&mdash;and another in your bonnet,
old man," the irrepressible lady answered, to his intense
disgust.</p>

<h2>IN THE HANDS OF THE GODS</h2>


<p>Arthur went to several more rehearsals, but as they
progressed, as the production took shape and final form,
they became to his unaccustomed mind painfully exciting,
so full of ups and downs, now ominous of defeat, now
presaging glorious victory. What were to the old hands ordinary
incidents and everyday vicissitudes were to him tragedies or
triumphs. If Mr. Etheringham said "That's better," or
"Well, we've got something like it at last," he swelled with
assurance, and his pockets with imaginary bullion. Whereas
if Mr. Etheringham flung his script down on the table and
exclaimed, "Well, it's not <i>my</i> money, thank God!"&mdash;or if
it appeared that there was no sort of chance of the scenery
being ready (and there very seldom is)&mdash;or if the author looked
more melancholy than usual (and Mr. Beverley had an extraordinary
and apparently inexhaustible gift for crescendos of
melancholy)&mdash;Arthur concluded that all was "up," and that
the shutters would soon follow the general example. In view
of the vital bearing which success had upon his financial
position, the strain was great, almost too exciting and thrilling
for endurance. More than once he swore that he would not
go near the place again&mdash;till "the night." But he could not
keep his oath. The fascination of the venture drew him back.
Besides he was attracted to his co-adventurers&mdash;to fiery Mr
Etheringham, with his relentless energy, his passionate pessimism
and furious outbursts; to the melancholy author,
surveying as it were a folly of his youth and reckoning on the
stupidity of the public to release him from "the office" and
let him "do" real life; to the leading man, war-worn hero
of a hundred farces, whose grey locks were to turn to raven-black,
and whose girth must suffer hard constriction to dimensions
that become a youthful lover&mdash;on the night; to Miss
Ayesha Layard with the audacious sillinesses which her
laughter and her impudent pug-nose made so strangely
acceptable. Even though Arthur had really no part in it all,
and nothing to do but sit and watch and smoke, he could not
keep away&mdash;and he rejoiced when somebody would come and
sit by, and exchange opinions. It says much for his resolutions
of reform that, in spite of all, he spent several hours every
day at chambers, trying to bend his mind to <i>Benjamin on
Sales</i> and, by virtue of the human interest of that remarkable
work, succeeding better than was to be expected.</p>

<p>Amidst these occupations and distractions the great trouble
which had come upon him was no longer the continual matter
of his thoughts. The sense of loss and the conviction of
folly&mdash;the two were inseparably united in consciousness&mdash;became
rather enemies lurking in the recesses of his mind,
ready to spring out at him in hours of idleness or depression.
To prevent or evade their attack was a task to which he set
himself more instinctively than of deliberate purpose; but
in fact the fear of them&mdash;the absolute need of keeping them
down unless he were to lose heart&mdash;co-operated with the good
resolutions he had made and with the new interests which had
come into his life. To seek fresh objects of effort and to lay
himself open to a new set of impressions&mdash;here rather than
in brooding, or remorse, or would-be philosophising, lay the
path of salvation for a spirit young, ardent, and elastic,
healthily averse from mental hypochondria, from nursing and
cosseting its wounds. He was in the mood of a football player
who, sore from a hack and shaken by a hard tackle, picks
himself up and rushes to take his place in the scrimmage.</p>

<p>Three days before "the night"&mdash;that date now served him
for a calendar&mdash;he received a hasty summons from Esther
Norton Ward. The lease of the Lisles' house in Hill Street
was to be sold, and Judith Arden had come up to town, to
settle matters relating to the furniture; some was to be
disposed of, some sent to Hilsey. The Norton Wards were at
home, the prospective candidate being engaged in an electoral
campaign in his prospective constituency, which could be
"worked" most easily from London; Judith was to stay a
few days with them. Though Norton Ward himself would be
away speech-making, the two ladies begged the pleasure of
Arthur's company that evening.</p>

<p>"Then Judith will be in town on the night," thought Arthur.
His eye gleamed with a brilliant inspiration. On the night he
would be the proud possessor of a box at the Burlington
Theatre&mdash;that, at least, his thousand pounds gave him. He
instantly determined to invite his friends to share it with him.
He added this invitation of his own when he sent his note
accepting Esther's.</p>

<p>"But how comes he to be having boxes at first nights?"
asked Esther.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you know? He's put up some money for the
play. Quite a lot, in fact," said Judith, with a laugh which
sounded apologetic.</p>

<p>Esther raised her brows. That was not the Norton Ward
idea of the way to the Woolsack. "Can he afford to&mdash;to do
that sort of thing? To take chances like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not! He's quite poor. But, Esther, I do
pray it'll be a success! He does deserve a turn of good luck.
He's been splendid to us all at Hilsey."</p>

<p>"He was making a great goose of himself, when I was at
Hilsey."</p>

<p>"That was before. I meant he was splendid afterwards.
Fancy seeing the play after all! He's often talked to me about
it."</p>

<p>"You're very good friends with him now?"</p>

<p>"Well, look what we've been through together! If the
piece doesn't succeed, I'm afraid it'll be a serious business for
him. He'll be very hard up."</p>

<p>Esther shook her head over Arthur when he came to dinner.
"I knew you were a man of fashion! Now you're blossoming
out as a theatrical speculator! Where does the law come
in?"</p>

<p>"Next Wednesday morning at the very latest&mdash;and whatever
has happened to <i>Did You Say Mrs.?</i> Only, if it's a
tumble, I shan't have the money to go circuit, and&mdash;well, I
hope your husband will get his rent, but I expect he'd be wiser
to kick me out of his chambers."</p>

<p>"As bad as that? Then we really must pray, Judith, for
Frank's sake as well as Arthur's!"</p>

<p>"Do tell us about the play! Give us an idea of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, the plot's not the great thing, you know. It's
the way it's written. And Ayesha Layard and Willie Spring
are so good. Well, there's a dancing club&mdash;a respectable one.
A man may take a man, but he may only take a woman if
she's his wife or sister. The man Spring plays is persuaded
to take a friend and his best girl in, and to let the girl call
herself Mrs. Skewes&mdash;Skewes is Spring's name in the piece.
Well, of course, as soon as he's done that, simply everybody
Skewes knows begins to turn up&mdash;his rich uncle, the rich girl
he wants to marry, his village parson&mdash;all the lot. And then
the other man's people weigh in, and everybody gets mixed&mdash;and
so on. And there's a comic waiter who used to know
Flo (Ayesha Layard plays Flo, of course) and insists on writing
to her mother to say she's married. Oh, it's all awfully well
worked out!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure it'll be very amusing," said Esther Norton Ward
politely. "But isn't it rather like that farce they had at the&mdash;the
Piccadilly, wasn't it?&mdash;a year or two ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! I remember the piece you mean; but that wasn't
a dancing club&mdash;that was an hotel."</p>

<p>"So it was. I forgot," said Esther, smiling.</p>

<p>Arthur burst into a laugh. "I'm a fool! Of course it's
been done a hundred times. But Beverley's got in a lot of
good stuff. In the second act Flo has hidden in Skewes'
bedroom, and of course everybody turns up there, and he has
to get rid of them by pretending he's going to have a bath&mdash;keeps
taking his coat off, to make 'em clear out." Arthur
chuckled at the remembrance. "But of course Ayesha's the
finest thing. Her innocent cheek is ripping!"</p>

<p>"Why does she want to hide in his room?"</p>

<p>"She took another woman's bag from the club by accident,
and the manager has his suspicions about her and consults
the police. But I won't tell you any more, or it'll spoil the
evening."</p>

<p>"I think we know quite enough to go on with," laughed
Esther. "I wish Frank could come with us, but he's got a meeting
every night next week. Why don't you go down with
him one night? I think it would amuse you."</p>

<p>"I will, like a shot, if he'll take me. I'm not sure, though,
that I'm a Conservative."</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter. Besides Frank will make you one.
He's very persuasive."</p>

<p>After Arthur had said good-night and gone, the two women
sat in silence for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"It sounds awful stuff, Judith," said Esther at last, in a
tone of candid regret.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does. But still those things do succeed
often."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, and we'll hope!" She glanced at Judith. "He
doesn't seem very&mdash;lovelorn!"</p>

<p>"He was pretty bad at first." She smiled faintly. "I had
to be awfully disagreeable. Well, I'm quite good at it. Ever
since then he's behaved wonderfully. But I don't know what
he feels."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope he'll settle down to work, after all this
nonsense."</p>

<p>"He hasn't got any work to settle to, poor boy!"</p>

<p>"Frank says it always comes if you watch and wait."</p>

<p>"I expect it's the successful men who say that." They had
all been gay at dinner, but now Judith's voice sounded
depressed and weary. Esther moved nearer to her side on the
sofa.</p>

<p>"You've had a pretty hard time of it too, haven't you?"
she asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>"It may be a funny thing, but I miss Bernadette dreadfully.
She was always an interest anyhow, wasn't she? And without
her&mdash;with just Godfrey and Margaret&mdash;Hilsey's awfully flat.
You see, we're none of us people with naturally high spirits.
Arthur is, and they used to crop out in spite of everything;
so it wasn't so bad while he was there. Godfrey and Margaret
are always wanting to press him to come back, but he must
stay and work, mustn't he?"</p>

<p>Esther took a sidelong glance at her&mdash;rather an inquisitive
glance&mdash;but she said no more than, "Of course he must. He
can come to you at Christmas&mdash;unless he's got another farce
or some other nonsense in his head."</p>

<p>Esther had taken Bernadette's flight with just a shrug of
her shoulders; that had seemed to her really the only way to
take it. She had not been surprised&mdash;looking back on her
Sunday at Hilsey and remembering Bernadette's manner, she
now declared that she had expected the event&mdash;and it was no
use pretending to be much shocked. To her steady and calm
temperament, very strong in affection but a stranger to passion,
a creature of Bernadette's waywardness could assert no real
claim to sympathy, however much her charm might be acknowledged.
She was surprised that Judith should miss her so much,
and with so much regret. For Arthur's infatuation she still
could have only scorn, however kindly the scorn might be. In
her eyes Bernadette had never been really a wife, and hardly in
any true sense a mother; by her flight she merely abdicated
positions which she had never effectively filled. She would
not even give her credit for courage in going away, in facing
the scandal; there she preferred to see only Oliver Wyse's
strong hand and imperious will.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was a true sympathy of mind between
her and Judith, and she was grieved, and rather indignant,
at the heavy burden which the train of events had laid
on Judith's shoulders. She asked something better for her
than to be merely the crutch of the crippled household at
Hilsey&mdash;for which again her self-reliant nature and courageous
temper had more pity than esteem. It would be a shame
if Judith sank into a household hack, bearing the burden
which properly belonged to Bernadette's pretty shoulders.
But Judith herself betrayed no sense of hardship; she took
what she was doing as a matter of course, though she did regret
Bernadette's loss and Arthur's absence. She pined for the
vanished elements of excitement and gaiety in the household;
but none the less she meant to stick to it. So Esther read her
mind. But there was another question&mdash;one of proportion.
How much of the pining was for Bernadette and how much
for Arthur?</p>

<p>It was dress rehearsal. Mr. Etheringham was a martinet
about admitting people to this function; there were only half-a-dozen
or so scattered about the stalls&mdash;and the author
prowling restlessly up and down the pit. Mr. Etheringham
sat by Arthur, his hat over his fiery eyes, regarding the performance
with a sort of gloomy resentment. He interfered
only once or twice&mdash;his work was done&mdash;but Arthur heard
him murmur, more than once or twice, "Damned bad&mdash;too
late to change!"&mdash;and therewith he sank a little lower down
in his seat. Arthur did not laugh much now, though he expected
to to-morrow; he was too busy thinking whether other
people would be amused to be amused himself. All he really
knew was that Willie Spring was acting his very heart out,
trying to get every ounce out of the part; and so was Ayesha,
for all her air of utter unconcern. He ventured on an observation
to this effect to Mr. Etheringham when the curtain fell
on the first act.</p>

<p>"They're all right. If it fails, it's my fault&mdash;and Beverley's."
He rushed off "behind," and his voice was heard
through the curtain in exhortation and correction.</p>

<p>Joe Halliday came across from the other side of the house
and sat down in the vacant seat. "Right as rain!" he
said emphatically. "You may order your motor car,
Arthur."</p>

<p>"I think I won't actually give the order till Wednesday
morning, old fellow."</p>

<p>"May as well. It's a cert. Big money! Wish I had your
share in it."</p>

<p>"I sometimes wish I had mine out," Arthur confessed.</p>

<p>"Oh, rot, man! It's the stroke of your life, this is."</p>

<p>Mr. Etheringham returned, glared at the imperturbable
Joe, and selected another stall. Second Act.</p>

<p>The Second Act went well, but when they came to set the
Third, there was a bad breakdown in the scenery. A long long
wait&mdash;and Mr. Etheringham audible from behind the curtain,
raging furiously. Mr. Beverley emerged from the pit and came
up behind Joe Halliday and Arthur.</p>

<p>"Just my luck!" he observed, in the apathetic calm of
utter despair.</p>

<p>"Jolly good thing it happened to-night, and not to-morrow!"
exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p>"But it probably will happen to-morrow too," the author
insisted.</p>

<p>Arthur was laughing at the two when Miss Ayesha Layard,
in the third of her wonderful frocks, came in front and tripped
up to them.</p>

<p>"If anybody's cold, they'd better go behind and listen to
old Langley," she remarked, as she sank into the stall by
Arthur's side. She had a large towel tied round her waist,
and adjusted it carefully beneath and round her before she
trusted her frock to the mercies of the seat. "I once spoilt a
frock in my early days, and old Bramston boxed my ears for
it," she explained to Arthur. Then she turned round and
regarded Mr. Beverley with an air of artless and girlish admiration.
"To think that he wrote this masterpiece! He who
is known to, and will soon be adored by, the public as Claud
Beverley, but who in private life&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up, will you!" commanded Mr. Beverley with sudden
and fierce fury. "If you do happen to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;" He was
in a difficulty for a phrase and ended without finding it&mdash;"Well,
you might have the decency to hold your tongue about it."</p>

<p>"Sorry, sorry, sorry! Didn't know it was such a secret as
all that." The offended man looked implacable. "If you
don't forgive me, I shall go and drown myself in that bath!
Oh, well, he won't, so never mind! Here, Joe, take him out
and give him a drink. There's just time before closing."</p>

<p>"First-rate idea!" Joe agreed cordially. "Come along,
old chap." Mr. Beverley allowed himself to be led away,
mournfully yet faintly protesting.</p>

<p>"Funny thing he should mind having his real name known,
isn't it? I'm sure I shouldn't mind mine being known,
if I had one, but I don't think I have. I recollect being called
'Sal' at the theatre. Old Bramston&mdash;the one who boxed
my ears, as I said&mdash;named me. He'd been out in the East as
a young man and liked reading about it. So, when he named
me, he combined his information, like the man in Dickens,
and made up the name you see on the bills. It'll descend to
posterity in old Langley Etheringham's memoirs. He's
writing them, his wife told me so. Well, what do you think
of the theatre&mdash;inside view&mdash;Mr. Lisle?"</p>

<p>"I think it's extraordinarily interesting."</p>

<p>"I've been in it all my life, and I wouldn't change. It
takes your mind off things so&mdash;sort of gives you two lives.
You come down here in the blues over your debts, or your love-affairs,
or something&mdash;and in five minutes you're somebody
else, or&mdash;" She gave a little laugh&mdash;"rotting somebody else,
which is nearly as good."</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's exactly what it does do!" cried Arthur.
"It's done me heaps of good."</p>

<p>"You'll have got something for your money, anyhow,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I want to get more than that!"</p>

<p>"So do I!" she laughed. "I want the salary. But one
never knows. This time to-morrow we may be waiting for
the laughs that don't come. You can always pretty well hear
Willie asking for them in the proper places. And when they
don't come, it's such a sell that it makes me want to giggle
myself. It might work! What the notices call my infectious
laughter!"</p>

<p>"Well, that's just what your laughter is."</p>

<p>"They catch a word like that from one another&mdash;like
mumps or measles. I'm always 'infectious;' Willie's always
'indefat'&mdash;'indefatig'&mdash;you know; I can never get to the
end of it! Bramston used to be 'sterling' always; it made
him just mad when he saw the word&mdash;used awful language!"
She laughed, "infectiously," at the recollection.</p>

<p>The hammering behind the curtain, which had been incessant
during their talk, stopped. A sharp voice rang out,
"Third Act!" There was a scurry of feet. Mr. Etheringham
came in front, very hot and dishevelled; Mr. Beverley reappeared,
only to bolt into his burrow in the pit. Miss Layard
rose to her feet, carefully lifting the precious frock well clear
of her ankles.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by keeping me waiting like this, Mr.
Etheringham?" she asked with elaborate haughtiness.</p>

<p>But poor Mr. Etheringham was at the end of his tether&mdash;beyond
repartee, even beyond fury.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, Ayesha my dear, take hold of this
damned third act, and pick it <i>up</i>!" he implored, with the old
Weary-Titan lift of his hands.</p>

<p>"There is a bit of avoirdupois about it, isn't there?" she
remarked sympathetically. "All the same, it's suffered a
sea-change under your accomplished hands, Langley."</p>

<p>"Oh, get round, there's a good girl, or you'll keep the stage
waiting."</p>

<p>"What one weak woman can do!" she said, with a nod and
a smile as she turned away.</p>

<p>Mr. Etheringham sank into a stall and lay back&mdash;with his
eyes shut. "I should like to have the blood of those stage-hands,"
Arthur heard him mutter.</p>

<p>His eyes remained closed right through the act; he knew it
too well to need to see it&mdash;every position, every speech, every
inflection, every gesture. He did not speak either; only
his hands now and then rose up above his head and dropped
again gently. When at last the curtain fell, he opened his eyes,
took off his hat, smoothed his hair, replaced the hat, and
turned to Arthur with a sudden expression of peace and relief
on his stormy countenance.</p>

<p>"Now it's in the hands of the gods, Mr. Lisle," he said.</p>

<p>Arthur was lighting a cigarette. In the intervals of the
operation he asked, "Well, what do you think?"</p>

<p>Mr. Etheringham looked at him with a tolerant smile.
"Think? My dear fellow, to-morrow's the night! What on
earth's the use of thinking?"</p>

<h2>TAKING MEDICINE</h2>


<p>"Good-night. Thanks awfully for coming, Mrs.
Norton Ward! And you too, Judith! Beg
pardon? Oh, yes, I hope so&mdash;with just a few
alterations. Wants a bit of pulling together, doesn't it?
What? Oh, yes, only quite a few&mdash;one fellow in the gallery
really started it. What? Oh, yes, up till then it was all
right&mdash;Yes, it will be really, I'm sure. Still I wish&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Move up there!" from the policeman.</p>

<p>"All the same I wish&mdash;Well, good-night. See you soon,
shan't I?"</p>

<p>Thus Arthur, outside the Burlington Theatre, bade farewell
to the two ladies who had honoured his box with their
presence&mdash;Arthur very suave, collected, smiling, easy, but
rather pale in the face. Under pressure from the policeman,
Esther's car drove off.</p>

<p>Esther gave a long sigh of relief. Judith had thrown herself
back in the other corner.</p>

<p>"It was very kind of him to take us," said Esther, "but
really what a trying evening, Judith! At first it seemed all
right&mdash;I laughed anyhow&mdash;but then&mdash;Oh, of course, they'd
no business to boo; it's rude and horrid. I was so sorry for
them all&mdash;especially that pretty girl and the poor man who
worked so hard. Still, you know, I couldn't see that it was
<i>very</i> funny."</p>

<p>No answer came from Judith's corner.</p>

<p>"And a farce ought to be funny, oughtn't it?" Esther
resumed. "Some plays one goes to without expecting to be
amused, of course, or&mdash;or even thrilled, or anything of that
sort. One goes to be&mdash;to be&mdash;well, because of one's interest
in the drama. But I always look forward to a farce; I expect
to enjoy myself at it."</p>

<p>Still no answer from Judith in the corner.</p>

<p>"And really I don't think I'll ever go again with anybody
who's got anything to do with the play. You felt him expecting
you to laugh&mdash;and you couldn't! Or you laughed in the
wrong place. He didn't laugh much himself, if you come to
that. Too anxious perhaps! And when he went out between
the acts and came back, and you asked him what the men were
saying, and he said, 'Oh, they always try to crab it!'&mdash;Well,
that didn't make it any more cheerful, did it?"</p>

<p>Response being still lacking, and Esther having pretty
well exhausted her own impressions of the first night of <i>Did
You Say Mrs.?</i> at the Burlington, she peered enquiringly
into the other corner of the car.</p>

<p>"Are you asleep, Judith?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not asleep. Never mind me, Esther."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you say something?"</p>

<p>"What is there to say?"</p>

<p>Esther peered more perseveringly into the corner. Then
she stretched out her hand towards the switch of the electric
light.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Judith, very sharply.</p>

<p>Esther's eyes grew wide. "Why, you silly girl, I believe
you're&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, and it's a very good thing to cry over. Think
of all those poor people, working so hard, and&mdash;it's all for
nothing, I suppose! And Arthur! How brave he was over
it! He couldn't have been more&mdash;more attentive and&mdash;and
gay if it had been the greatest success. But I knew
what he was feeling. I laughed like a maniac&mdash;and my
hands are sore. What's the use? Who's the idiot who
wrote it?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you come to that, I daresay the poor man is just
as much upset as Arthur Lisle is."</p>

<p>Judith was in no mood for impartial justice. "Getting
them to produce a thing like that is almost obtaining money
under false pretences. Why don't they <i>know</i>, Esther?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't know. It's easy enough to tell when you
see it."</p>

<p>"I was awfully frightened even when he told us about it."</p>

<p>"At dinner, you mean? Yes, so was I. But it was no use
saying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, it was no use saying anything about it!
What will he do now? Will he get any of his money back, I
wonder!" Judith might be seen through the gloom dabbing
her cheeks forlornly. "And I did think it was going to be a
jolly evening!" she ended.</p>

<p>"It wasn't that," Esther observed with ample emphasis.
Protected by the gloom, she drew nearer to Judith, put her
arm round her, and kissed her. "You mustn't mind so much,"
she whispered. "Men have to take tumbles all the time, and
Arthur took his bravely."</p>

<p>"Oh, after the other thing it is such hard luck! And I&mdash;we&mdash;didn't
know how to&mdash;to help or console him. I wish
Bernadette had been there! She'd have known how to do
that."</p>

<p>Esther frowned at the idea of this very desperate remedy.
A forlorn silence fell on the car, till they reached home
and got out. In the hall Esther laid a hand on Judith's
arm.</p>

<p>"Frank will be back by now. Are you equal to facing
him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'd sooner not, if you don't mind. I shall go to bed."</p>

<p>"Don't fret. Perhaps they will&mdash;pull it together, didn't
he say?&mdash;really!"</p>

<p>Judith shook her head mournfully and trailed off upstairs
to bed. The hostess stood watching her guest's progress for
a moment with what seemed a rather critical eye, and then
went in to her husband's study.</p>

<p>Frank Norton Ward was seated in front of a tray, and was
consuming cold beef and claret with an excellent appetite.
An open-air meeting at seven, followed by a church bazaar
(with "a few words" from the prospective candidate) from
eight-thirty till ten, had been his useful, honourable, but
exhausting evening.</p>

<p>"Well, here you are!" he greeted his wife cheerfully.
"Had a good time, Esther?"</p>

<p>His question opened the gates again to the doleful flood
of Esther's impressions. Her husband listened with a smile;
to the detached mind a fiasco has always its amusing side,
and Norton Ward was by no means particularly concerned
about Arthur or his fortunes. He finished his claret and lit
his pipe during the sorrowful recital, and at the end of it
remarked, "Well, it serves him right, really. That sort of
thing won't do him any good&mdash;it's not his job&mdash;and perhaps
now he'll see it. Didn't Judith come in with you?"</p>

<p>"She's gone to bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, has she? I say, I had a jolly good meeting to-night&mdash;though
it's supposed to be a Radical centre. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She was reduced to tears, coming home in the car.
Tears, Frank!"</p>

<p>"That's rather a strong order, isn't it? She'll be all right
in the morning. The fact is, there's been a good deal of
trouble at the biscuit works, and since old Thorne's a Liberal,
his men&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She must be a good deal&mdash;well, interested in him to do
that!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't mind giving him one in the eye. What? I
beg your pardon, my dear?"</p>

<p>Even in the happiest marriages husband and wife do not
always pursue the same train of thought. But Esther was
very dutiful. "Never mind! Tell me about the meeting,"
she said. But she went on thinking of Judith and her tears.</p>

<p>After he had seen his friends off, Arthur turned back into
the lobby of the theatre. The crowd, that destructive crowd,
was thinning quickly; at the tail-end of it there came, hurrying
along, a figure vaguely familiar. The next instant its
identity was established. There was no mistaking the tremor
of the eye. It was Mr. Mayne, of Wills and Mayne, of <i>Tiddes
v. The Universal Omnibus Company, Limited</i>.. As he came up,
he saw Arthur, and gave him a quick glance and a faint smile,
but no express recognition. He hurried by, as it were
furtively, and, before Arthur had time to claim acquaintance,
disappeared into the street. "Shouldn't have imagined he
was much of a first-nighter!" thought Arthur, as he made
his way towards a little group standing by the Box Office.</p>

<p>The two Sarradet men were there, talking in low voices
but volubly, gesticulating, looking very angry and somehow
unusually French. Marie stood with her arm in Sidney
Barslow's, rather as if she needed his support, and the big
man himself, smiling composedly, seemed as though he were
protecting the family. Fronting them stood Joe Halliday,
smoking a cigarette and listening to the voluble talk with a
pleasant smile.</p>

<p>But when the two men saw Arthur, their talk stopped&mdash;silenced
perhaps by the presence of a pecuniary disaster
greater than that which had befallen the Sarradet house.
Joe seized his opportunity and remarked, "After all, Mr.
Sarradet, you didn't exactly suppose you were investing in a
gilt-edged security!"</p>

<p>"I say, where's poor old Beverley?" Arthur asked.</p>

<p>"Behind, I think&mdash;talking it over with Etheringham.
Well, let 'em talk!" He shaped his lips for a whistle, but
thought better of it. "We'll have another flutter some day,
Mr. Sarradet!" he remarked with an air of genial encouragement.</p>

<p>"Flutter!" The old man was choking with indignation.
"If I ever&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Well, we'd best be getting home," Sidney interposed,
with an authority which made the suggestion an order.
"Come along, Marie."</p>

<p>"Bring Pops, Raymond," Marie directed. She gave her free
hand to Arthur, raising mournful eyes to his. "What a
terrible experience!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"He calls it a flutter!"&mdash;A fragment of old Sarradet's
indignation was blown back from the pavement into the
lobby.</p>

<p>"Not sports!" Joe mused regretfully. "Not what I call
sports, Arthur! I'm really rather sorry we didn't manage to
rope old Sidney in too. Looking so dashed wise, wasn't he?
Come along, let's find Claud&mdash;and I want to see Ayesha."</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall have to settle what's to be done about
it, shan't we?"</p>

<p>"We'll hear what Langley thinks."</p>

<p>They found a little party in Mr. Etheringham's room&mdash;that
gentleman himself, standing with his back to the fireplace,
smoking a cigar; Willie Spring, an exhausted volcano,
lying back in a chair, staring at the ceiling; Miss Ayesha
Layard on the sofa, smiling demurely; and the author
seated at the table with the script of the play in front of him;
he was turning over the leaves quickly and with an appearance
of eager industry.</p>

<p>"Now we know what to think, don't we, Mr. Lisle?
They've done our thinking for us." Mr. Etheringham
smiled quite pleasantly. He was not at all fiery now.</p>

<p>Arthur laid his hand on Mr. Beverley's shoulder. "It's an
infernal shame, old chap. I'm most awfully sorry."</p>

<p>"You gentlemen are two of the principal shareholders,"
Mr. Etheringham went on to Arthur and Joe. "Perhaps
you'd like to talk over the situation privately?"</p>

<p>"We're all right as we are&mdash;glad of words of wisdom from
any of you! How do we stand, Langley?" said Joe, sitting
down on the sofa by Miss Layard. "What's the situation?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know that as well as I do. There's the production
to be paid&mdash;about twelve hundred, I reckon&mdash;and we
run into about eight hundred a week."</p>

<p>"And what&mdash;if any&mdash;business shall we play to?"</p>

<p>"You can't tell that. You can only guess&mdash;and you'd
better not guess high! I should say myself that the money
might last a fortnight&mdash;possibly three weeks. Some of 'em'll
probably look in now and then, you know&mdash;and even if we
paper the whole house, the bars bring in a bit."</p>

<p>"I'd go a bit more," said Joe, "only the truth is I haven't
got a bob&mdash;absolutely stony!" He jingled the money in his
pocket. "Hear that&mdash;it's the last of it!"</p>

<p>"If you think there's any chance," Arthur began eagerly,
"I think I could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Willie Spring's eyes came down from the ceiling and
sought those of Mr. Etheringham; Mr. Spring also shook
his head very slightly and smiled a tired smile.</p>

<p>"I don't think we'd better talk about that at this stage,"
said Mr. Etheringham. "At least that's my advice. Of
course, if later on the business warranted the hope that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, let's go on as long as the money lasts,"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>"All right. Can you be ready with those cuts and the new
lines by to-morrow afternoon, Beverley?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He had never stopped turning over the pages of
the script.</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll call a rehearsal for two o'clock."</p>

<p>Ayesha Layard rose from the sofa. "Well, good-night,"
she said.</p>

<p>"May I wait for you?" asked Joe.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like, but I want to speak to Mr. Lisle first."
As she passed Arthur, she took hold of his arm and led him
to her dressing-room. "Just a second!" she said to her
dresser. When the woman had gone out, she planted herself
in the chair before the looking-glass and regarded Arthur
with a smile. "Were you really ready to put up more
money?" she asked. "Are you a millionaire? Because
you're not in love with me, and that's the only other thing
that might explain it."</p>

<p>"I hate being beat," Arthur protested.</p>

<p>"Happened to you before, hasn't it? In other directions,
I mean."</p>

<p>Just as he was looking at her, wondering how much she
knew&mdash;for something she evidently knew&mdash;a knock came at
the door, and the dresser appeared with a telegram in her
hand. "You're Mr. Lisle, sir, aren't you? This came for
you just as the curtain went up, and it got forgotten till now."
She gave it to Arthur and went out again.</p>

<p>"May I read it?" He opened it. "Good luck to you
to-night. I wish I could be with you, but circumstances
don't permit&mdash;Bernadette." The despatch came from Genoa.
Bernadette had looked out for the doings of <i>Did You Say Mrs.?</i>
in the English papers!</p>

<p>"Yes, it's happened to me before," said Arthur, smiling
rather grimly. He put the piece of paper into her hands.
"A telegram of good wishes&mdash;come to hand rather late."</p>

<p>"Bernadette? A lady friend? Oh, I remember! <i>The</i>
lady-friend, isn't it? She thinks of you! Touching!"</p>

<p>"I find it so, rather. But, I say, aren't you tired to
death?"</p>

<p>"Next door! But I just wanted to say good-bye to you.
I like you, you know. You're pleasant, and you lose like a
gentleman, and you haven't rounded on Willie and me, and
told us it's all our fault."</p>

<p>"Your fault indeed! You were splendid. And mayn't it
be just good-night, and not good-bye, Miss Layard?"</p>

<p>"Call it which you like. I know what it will be. This
isn't your line, really. Good-night then&mdash;and don't give Joe
any more money. He'd break the Bank of England, if they'd
let him."</p>

<p>"I won't then. And I like you, if I may say so. And
we're all tremendously in your debt." He raised the hand
she gave him to his lips and kissed it in a courtly fashion.</p>

<p>He looked handsome as he did it, and she was amused that
he should do it. She looked up at him with dancing eyes and
a merry laugh. "Kiss me good-bye, then, really, if you mean
it&mdash;and don't be too disgusted with all of us to-morrow
morning!"</p>

<p>He kissed her cheek, laughing. "<i>Au revoir!</i> I shan't be
disgusted with you anyhow. Good-night."</p>

<p>He walked to the door, and was just going to open it when
she spoke again. "Mr. Lisle!"</p>

<p>"Yes." He turned round. She was standing by the
table now; her face was very bright; she seemed to struggle
against another spasm of laughter. "In the stress of business
you've forgotten your telegram from&mdash;Bernadette!" She
waved the missive in her hand, holding her mutinous lips
closely together.</p>

<p>Arthur stood for a moment, looking at the lady and the
missive. Then he broke into a hearty roar; she let herself go
too; their laughter rang through the little room. The door
was flung open, and Joe Halliday appeared on the threshold
in a state of some indignation.</p>

<p>"Pretty good to keep me waiting out in the cold while
you&mdash;what have you been up to, Ayesha?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that concerns you, Joe. I've been giving Mr.
Lisle some medicine."</p>

<p>"I should have thought we'd all had enough of that
to-night!"</p>

<p>"It's a different sort&mdash;and different from any I shall give
you. But I think it did him good, from the symptoms. Oh,
here's your wire, Mr. Lisle!"</p>

<p>She seemed to sparkle with mischief as she gave it to him.
"Now mind you don't give Joe any medicine!" he said.</p>

<p>"The bottle's finished, for to-night at all events." With
this gay promise and a gay nod she let him go.</p>

<p>Pleased at the promise&mdash;quite absurdly pleased at it, in
spite of its strict time-limit&mdash;and amused with the whole
episode, he put Bernadette's telegram in his pocket, and
walked along towards the stage-door, smiling happily. He
was not thinking about the telegram, nor about the fiasco of
the evening, nor of his thousand pounds, very little or none
of which would ever find its way back into his pocket. The
emotions which each and all of these subjects for contemplation
might have been expected to raise had been put to rout.
A very fine medicine, that of Miss Ayesha Layard's!</p>

<p>He said good-night to the doorkeeper and gave him a
sovereign; he said good-night to the fireman and gave him
ten shillings; it was no moment for small economies, and
he was minded to march out with colours flying. But he
was not quite done with the Burlington Theatre yet. Outside
was a tall figure which moved to his side directly he
appeared. It was Mr. Claud Beverley, carrying his play in a
large square envelope.</p>

<p>"Are you going anywhere, Lisle?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Only home&mdash;up Bloomsbury way."</p>

<p>"May I walk with you! The tube at Tottenham Court
Road suits me to get home."</p>

<p>"Why, of course! Come along, old chap." They started
off together up Shaftesbury Avenue. Mr. Beverley said
nothing till they had got as far as the Palace Theatre. Then
he managed to unburden his heart.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you how sorry I am to&mdash;to have let you in
like this, Lisle. I feel pretty badly about it, I can tell you,
for all their sakes. But you've been specially&mdash;well, you
took me on trust, and I've let you in."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, it's all right. It's much worse for you
than for me. But I hope the new play will put you all right."</p>

<p>The author would not be silenced. "And I want to say
that if ever I can do you a turn&mdash;a real good turn&mdash;I'll do it.
If it's to be done, I'll do it!"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you will," said Arthur, who did not in the least
see what Mr. Beverley could do for him, but was touched by
his evident sincerity.</p>

<p>"There's my hand on it," said Mr. Beverley with solemnity.
There in Charing Cross Road they shook hands on the
bargain. "Don't forget! Good-night, Lisle. Don't forget!"
He darted away across the road and vanished into
the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>Arthur Lisle strolled on to his lodgings, humming a tune.
Good sort, weren't they, all of them? Suddenly he yawned,
and became aware of feeling very tired. Been an evening,
hadn't it?</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later he tumbled into bed, with a happy
smile still on his lips. He could not get the picture of that
girl waving the telegram at him out of his head.</p>

<h2>TEARS AND A SMILE</h2>


<p>IN the end the Syndicate left to Joe Halliday the responsibility
of deciding on the future of the unfortunate farce,
so far as it had a future on which to decide. On mature
reflection Joe was for acting on the sound business principle
of 'cutting a loss,' and the turn of events reinforced his
opinion. They had taken the Burlington for four weeks certain,
and the liability for rent was a serious fact and a heavy
item to reckon with. Another dramatic venture wanted a
home, and Joe had the opportunity of sub-letting the theatre
for the last two weeks of the term. By and with the advice of
Mr. Etheringham he closed with the offer. <i>Did You Say Mrs?</i>
dragged on for its fortnight, never showing vitality enough to
inspire any hope of its recovering from the rude blow of the
first night. In the day-time new figures filled the stage of the
Burlington, new hopes and fears centred there. Only Mr.
Etheringham remained, producing the new venture with the
same fiery and inexhaustible energy, lifting dead weights
with his hands, toiling, moiling, in perpetual strife. Gone
soon were all the others who had become so familiar, from
the great Mr. Spring, the Indefatigable, downwards, some to
other engagements, some left "out"&mdash;<i>dÃ©bris</i> from the wreck
of the unhappy <i>Did You Say Mrs?</i></p>

<p>Gone too, soon, was Miss Ayesha Layard with her infectious
laugh. For her sake Arthur had sat through the farce once
again&mdash;not even for her sake twice, so inconceivably flat had
it now become to him. He had gone round and seen her, but
she had other guests and no real conversation was possible.
Then he saw in the papers that she was to go to America; a
manager from that country had come to see the piece, and,
though he did not take that, he did take Miss Layard, with
whose talents he was much struck. He offered a handsome
salary, and she jumped at it. Joe let her go three days before
the end of the hopeless little run. One of the last items of the
Syndicate's expenditure was a bouquet of flowers, presented
to her at Euston on the morning of her departure. Arthur
went to see her off, found her surrounded by folk strange to
him, had just a hand-clasp, a hearty greeting, a merry flash
from her eyes, and, as he walked off, the echo of her laugh for
a moment in his ears. The changes and chances of theatrical
life carried her out of his orbit as suddenly as she had come
into it; she left behind her, as chief legacy, just that vivid
memory which linked her so fantastically with Bernadette.</p>

<p>So the whole thing seemed to him to end&mdash;the Syndicate,
the speculation, his voyage into the unknown seas of the
theatre. It was all over, shattered by a blow almost as sudden,
almost as tragical, as that which had smitten his adoration
itself. Both of these things, always connected together for
him by subtle bonds of thought and emotion, making together
the chief preoccupation of the last six months of his life, now
passed out of it, and could occupy his days no longer. They
had come like visions&mdash;Bernadette in her barouche, the
glittering thousands dangled in Fortune's hand&mdash;and seemed
now to depart in like fashion, transitory and unsubstantial.</p>

<p>Yet to Arthur Lisle they stood as the two greatest things
that had up to now happened in his life, the most significant
and the most vivid. Set together&mdash;as they insisted on being
set together from the beginning to the end, from the first
impulse of ambition roused by Bernadette to the coming of
her telegram on that momentous evening&mdash;they made his
first great venture, his most notable experience. They had
revealed and developed his nature, plumbed feeling and tested
courage. He was different now from Marie Sarradet's placid,
contented, half-condescending wooer, different from him who
had worshipped Bernadette with virgin eyes&mdash;different now
even from the forsaken and remorseful lover of that black
hour at Hilsey. He had received an initiation&mdash;a beginning
of wisdom, an opening of the eyes, a glimpse of what a man's
life may be and hold and do for him. He had seen lights
glimmering on the surface of other lives, and now and
then, however dimly and fitfully, revealing their deeper
waters.</p>

<p>Sitting among the ruins&mdash;if tangible results were regarded,
scarcely any other word could be considered appropriate&mdash;and
acutely awake to what had happened to his fortunes, he
was vaguely conscious of what had happened to himself. The
feeling forbade remorse or despair; it engendered courage.
It enabled him to infuse even a dash of humour into his
retrospect of the past and his survey of the present. If he
still called himself a fool, he did it more good-naturedly, and
perhaps really more in deference to the Wisdom of the Wise
and the Prudence of the Elders than out of any genuine or
deep-seated conviction. And anyhow, if he had been a fool,
he reckoned that he had learnt something from it. Everybody
must be a fool sometimes. In prudent eyes he had been a
tolerably complete one, and had paid and must pay for the
indulgence. But it had not been all loss&mdash;so his spirit insisted,
and refused sack-cloth and ashes for its wear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the bill! Not the rather nebulous
balance-sheet of his soul's gains and losses, but the debit
account in hard cash. A few sovereigns from the five hundred
still jingled forlornly in his pocket; a few might possibly,
thanks to the sub-let, stray back from the Burlington Theatre,
but not many. In round figures he was fifteen hundred pounds
out, and was left with an income barely exceeding a hundred
pounds a year. Now that would not support the life and meet
the necessary expenses of counsel learned in the law. Other
prospects he had none; what his mother had Anna was to
take. He did not want to give up the Bar; he still remembered
Mr. Tiddes with a thrill; Wills and Mayne were alive&mdash;at any
rate Mayne was; a third defeat from fortune was not to his
liking. Moreover to abandon his chosen career would nearly
break his mother's heart. He came to a swift determination
to "stick it out" until he had only a thousand pounds left.
If that moment came, a plunge into something new! For the
present, all useful expenditure, but strict economy! He
instructed his broker to sell out two hundred pounds' worth of
stock and felt that he had achieved a satisfactory solution
of his financial troubles.</p>

<p>For a mind bent on industry&mdash;and Arthur flattered himself
that his really was now&mdash;his chambers offered new opportunities.
Norton Ward had got his silk gown. His pupils had
disappeared; Arthur could have the run of his work, could
annotate and summarise briefs, and try his hand on draft
"opinions." This was much more alluring work than
reading at large. He could sit in court too, and watch
the progress of the cases with a paternal, a keener, and a
more instructed interest. This was how he planned to spend
the winter sittings, rejecting the idea of going circuit&mdash;the
chances of gain were so small, the expenses involved so great.
But in the immediate future things fell out differently from
what he had planned.</p>

<p>The morning after the Courts opened, he received a summons
to go and see Mr. Justice Lance in his private room.
The old Judge gave him a very friendly greeting and, being
due to take his seat in five minutes, opened his business
promptly.</p>

<p>"My old friend Horace Derwent, who generally comes with
me as Marshal, is down with influenza and won't be available
for three or four weeks. Esther Norton Ward was at my
house yesterday and, when she heard it, she suggested that
perhaps you'd like to take his place. I shall be very glad to
take you, if you care to come. If anything crops up for you
here, you can run up&mdash;because Marshals aren't absolutely indispensable
to the administration of justice. Your function
is to add to my comfort and dignity&mdash;and I shan't let that
stand in your way."</p>

<p>"It's most awfully kind of you. I shall be delighted,"
said Arthur.</p>

<p>"Very well. We start on Monday, and open the Commission
at Raylesbury. My clerk will let you know all the details.
If you sit in court regularly, I don't think your time will be
wasted, and a grateful country pays you two guineas a day&mdash;not
unacceptable, possibly, at this moment!" His eyes
twinkled. Arthur felt that his theatrical speculation had
become known.</p>

<p>"It's uncommonly acceptable, I assure you, Sir Christopher,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Then let's hope poor Horace Derwent will make a leisurely
convalescence," smiled the Judge.</p>

<p>In high spirits at the windfall, Arthur started off in the
afternoon to thank Esther for her good offices. He had not
seen her since they parted, with forced cheerfulness, at the doors
of the Burlington Theatre; neither had he carried out his
idea of going to one of her husband's meetings; the urgency
of his own affairs would have dwarfed those of the nation in his
eyes, even had his taste for politics been greater than it was.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd like it. You'll find Sir Christopher a
pleasant chief, and perhaps it'll keep you out of mischief for
a few weeks&mdash;and in pocket-money," said Esther, in reply to
his thanks.</p>

<p>"I've got no more mischief in view," Arthur remarked,
almost wistfully. "My wild course is run."</p>

<p>"I hope so. Did you ever believe in that terrible farce?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, rather! That is, I believed in it generally&mdash;Moments
of qualm! That's what made it so interesting."</p>

<p>"That evening, Arthur! I declare I still shudder! What
did you do after you got rid of us? Knock your head against
the wall, or go to bed to hide your tears?"</p>

<p>Arthur smiled. "Not exactly, Mrs. Norton Ward. I took
part in a sort of Privy Council, about ways and means, though
there weren't any of either, to speak of&mdash;and Claud Beverley
swore eternal friendship to me, heavens knows why! And I
had a talk with Miss Layard."</p>

<p>Esther was looking at his smiling face in some amazement;
he seemed to find the memory of the evening pleasant and
amusing. Her own impressions were so different that she was
stirred to resentment. "I believe I wasted some good emotion
on you," she observed severely.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot! I had a telegram from Bernadette&mdash;from
Genoa. Good wishes, you know&mdash;but I never got it till it was
all over." He was smiling still, in a ruminative way now.</p>

<p>"Very attentive of her! It seems to amuse you, though."</p>

<p>"Well, it was rather funny. It came when I was in Ayesha
Layard's dressing-room, talking to her, and she&mdash;well, rather
made fun of it."</p>

<p>Esther eyed him with curiosity. "Did you like that?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I didn't seem to mind it at the time." His tone was
amused still, but just a little puzzled. "No, I didn't mind
it."</p>

<p>"I believe&mdash;yes, I do&mdash;I believe you were flirting with the
impudent little creature! Oh, you men! This is what we get!
We cry our eyes out for you, and all the time you're&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"Men must work and women must weep!" said Arthur.</p>

<p>"That's just what Judith was doing&mdash;literally&mdash;all the
way home in the car; and in bed afterwards, very likely."
Esther rapped out the disclosure tartly. "And all the while
you were&mdash;&mdash;!" Words failed the indignant woman.</p>

<p>"Cried? What, not really? Poor old Judith! What a
shame! I must write to her and tell her I'm as jolly as
possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay she's got over it by now," said Esther,
with a dig at his vanity. But he accepted the suggestion with
a cheerful alacrity which disappointed her malice.</p>

<p>"Of course she has! She's a sensible girl. What's the good
of crying?"</p>

<p>"Would you have liked to be asked that at all moments of
your life, Arthur?"</p>

<p>He laughed. "Rather a searching question sometimes,
isn't it? But poor Judith! I had no idea&mdash;&mdash;" His remorse,
though genuine enough, was still tinged with amusement. The
smile lurked about his mouth.</p>

<p>Esther's resentment, never very serious, melted away.
In the end there was something attractive in his disposition
to refuse even a sympathy which was too soft. She thought
that she saw change there. Hard knocks had been chipping
off a youthful veneer of sentimentality. But she would not
have him impute a silly softness to Judith. "And Judith's
not a crying woman. I know her," she said.</p>

<p>"I know. She's got no end of courage. That's why it's
so queer."</p>

<p>"She thought your heart was broken, you see."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;well, I think she ought to know me better
than that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she doesn't always keep up with you," Esther
suggested.</p>

<p>Rather to her surprise he let the suggestion go by, and did
not seize the opportunity it offered of considering or discussing
himself&mdash;his character and its development. Instead, he
began to talk about the Marshalship once more, full of interest
and pleasure in it, looking forward to the companionship of
Sir Christopher, to seeing and learning, to the touches of old
pomp and ceremony in which he was to assist, unimportantly
indeed, but as a favourably placed spectator.</p>

<p>"I'm more grateful to you than I can say," he declared.
"And not for the two guineas a day only!"</p>

<p>His gratitude gave her pleasure, but she could not understand
his mood fully. Her nature moved steadily and equably
on its own lines; so far as she could remember, it always had,
aided thereto by the favouring circumstances of assured
position, easy means, and a satisfactory marriage. She did
not appreciate the young man's reaction after a long period
of emotion and excitement, of engrossment in his personal
feelings and fortunes. With these he was, for the moment,
surfeited, and disposed, consequently, to turn on them a
critical, almost a satiric, eye. The need of his mind now was
for calmer interests, more impersonal subjects of observation
and thought. He was looking forward to being a spectator, a
student of other people's lives, acts, and conditions&mdash;he was
welcoming the prospect of a period during which his mind
would be turned outward towards the world. He had had
enough of himself for the time being.</p>

<p>It was not, then, a moment in which he was likely to ask
himself very curiously the meaning of Judith's tears, or to find
in them much stuff to feed either remorse or vanity. He was
touched, he was a little ashamed, though with twitching lips,
as he contrasted them with his farewell to Ayesha Layard at
approximately the same moment. But on the whole he felt
relieved of a matter with which he had little inclination to
occupy himself when Esther said, at parting, "I think on the
whole you'd better not say anything to Judith about what I
told you; she might be angry with me for giving her away."</p>

<p>Judith might well have thought herself betrayed by the
disclosure which Esther had made in her irritated curiosity,
in her resentful desire to confront the smiling young man with
the pathetic picture of a girl in tears. When a woman says
to a man, of another woman, "See how fond she is of you!"
there is generally implied the reproach, "And you under-rate,
you slight, you don't return, her affection." Such a reproach
had certainly underlain the contrast Esther drew between
Judith's tears and the smiles in which Arthur had presumably
indulged during his talk with Ayesha Layard. But Arthur
took the contrast lightly; it did not really come home to him;
he did not seek to explore its possible meaning, the suggestion
contained in it. Lightly too he seemed to have taken Bernadette's
telegram&mdash;her recollection of him at a crisis of his
fortunes, coming out of the silence and darkness in which her
flight had wrapped her. Here was a thing which might surely
have moved him to emotion, rousing poignant memories?
But when Miss Ayesha Layard rather made fun of it, he had
not minded! Even this account of what had happened&mdash;this
faint adumbration of the truth&mdash;agreed ill with Esther's
previous conception of him.</p>

<p>But it was of a piece with his new mood, with the present
turn of his feelings under the stress of fortune. To this mood
matters appertaining to women&mdash;to use the old phrase, the
female interest&mdash;did not belong. He was liberated for the
time from the attack of that, from his obsession with it, and
in his freedom was turning a detached, a critical, eye on his
days of bondage. Rather oddly it had been a woman's work,
not indeed to bring about his release, but still to mark the
moment when he began to be conscious of it; for the turn of
the tide of his mind was marked by the moment when, in
kissing Ayesha Layard, he forgot his telegram. That little
episode satirically mocked the erstwhile devotee and the inconsolable
lover, and all the more because it hovered itself
pleasantly near the confines of sentiment. It pointedly
and recurringly reminded him that there were more women
than one in the world, that there were, in fact, a great many.
And when a young man's heart is open to the consideration
that there are a great many women in the world, it is, for all
serious purposes, much the same with him as though there were
none.</p>

<p>Esther Norton Ward was not in possession of the full facts,
or she might better have understood why Arthur's smile had
resisted even the appeal of Judith's tears.</p>

<p>On the last evening before he left London, he dined with
Joe Halliday and, with a heart opened by good wine, Joe
gave his personal view of the Burlington Theatre disaster.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I let the Sarradets and Amabel in," he said,
"and of course I'm awfully sorry I stuck you for such a lot&mdash;though
that was a good deal your own doing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was all my own doing," Arthur protested.</p>

<p>"And I'm sorry for everybody involved, but for myself I
don't care much. As long as a fellow's got a dinner inside him
and five quid in his pocket, what's there to worry about?
I've got lots of other jobs maturing. In fact, as far as I'm
personally concerned, perhaps it's rather a good thing we did
take such a toss. The fact is, old chap, I was getting most
infernally gone on Ayesha."</p>

<p>"I thought you were touched! Well, she's very attractive."</p>

<p>"You're right! If we'd run a hundred nights, I should
have been a fair goner! And on the straight too, mind you!
Even as it is, I don't mind telling you&mdash;as a pal&mdash;that I'm
hardly my usual bright self since she went to Yankeeland.
Keep thinking what's she up to&mdash;like a silly ass! Beastly!
And what did I get out of it? Nothing!" His voice grew
plaintively indignant. "On my word, not so much as that,
Arthur!" With the words he put two fingers to his lips and
flung a kiss to the empty air.</p>

<p>"That was rather hard lines," Arthur remarked, smiling,
pleased to hear that, so far as Joe was concerned at least,
Miss Ayesha's promise about her medicine had been handsomely
kept.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you wouldn't notice it much"&mdash;(A veiled
allusion to the Romantic and Forsaken Lover!)&mdash;"but she's
enough to make any man make a fool of himself over her."
He heaved a ponderous sigh. "I expect I'm well out of it!
She'd never have given me more than a string of beads to
play with. And if by a miracle she had succumbed to my
charms, I should have been as jealous as a dog every time she
went to the theatre! No sound way out of it! All just silly!"
He looked up and caught Arthur smiling at him. He burst
into a laugh, "Lord, what an ass I am! Come along, old chap!
If we get moving, we shall be just in time to see Trixie Kayper
at the Amphitheatre. I hear she knocks stars out of High
Heaven with her twinkling feet!"</p>

<p>Arthur agreed that the performance was one not to be
missed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

<h2>A VARIETY SHOW</h2>


<p>The Majesty of the Law&mdash;nay, in theory at least,
the Majesty of England&mdash;sat enthroned at Raylesbury.
In the big chair in the centre the Honourable
Sir Christopher Lance, in his newly powdered wig and his
scarlet robes&mdash;the "Red Judge" whose splendour solaces
(so it is said) even the prisoners with a sense of their own
importance. On his right the High Sheriff, splendid also in
Deputy-Lieutenant's uniform, but bored, sleepy after a
good lunch, and half-stifled by sitting indoors all day in bad
air, instead of agreeably killing something under the open
vault of Heaven. Beyond him the Chaplain, smooth-faced,
ruddy, rather severe, in gown and cassock of silk so fine and
stiff as to seem capable of standing up straight on its own
account, even if His Reverence chanced not to be inside.
At the end, the Under-Sheriff, unobtrusively ready to come
to his Chief's assistance. On his Lordship's left&mdash;a sad
falling off in impressiveness&mdash;Arthur in mufti, and on his
other side Mr. Williams, the Judge's clerk, a fat man of
constant but noiseless activity, ever coming in and going
out, fetching nothing from nowhere and taking it back again
(at any rate so far as the casual spectator could perceive).
Behind, such county magistrates as were attracted by
curiosity or by a laudable desire to take a lesson in doing
justice. In front, to right and left, and down below, divided
from this august company (for even on Marshal and Clerk
fell rays of reflected dignity) the world of struggle&mdash;the Bar,
the solicitors, jury, witnesses, prisoners, spectators, with
great policemen planted at intervals like forest-trees amongst
the scrub. For mainspring of the whole machine, the Clerk
of Assize, a charming and courtly old gentleman, telling everybody
what to do and when to do it, polite, though mostly
unintelligible, to the prisoners, confidential and consolatory
to the jury, profoundly anxious that nothing should ruffle
so much as a hair of his lordship's wig.</p>

<p>In the morning they had tried a yokel for stealing a pig.
The defence&mdash;a guinea's worth&mdash;eloquently advanced and
ardently pressed&mdash;was that the prosecutor had presented
the prisoner with the pig in a moment of conviviality. The
prosecutor met the suggestion with amazement, the jury with
smiles: one might get drunk, but no man was ever so drunk
as to give his pig away! Verdict&mdash;Guilty. His Lordship
passed a light sentence, faintly smiling over the ways of a
world which, after nearly fifty years in the law and eighteen
on the Bench, still remained to him rather remote and incomprehensible.
This case of the pig was a merry case. It
lent itself to jokes, and young Bertie Rackstraw's caricature
(he solaced briefless days with art) of counsel for the defence
arm-in-arm with a gowned and bewigged pig was circulated and
much admired. <i>Pignus amoris</i>, another wag wrote under it.</p>

<p>Now, in the afternoon, a different atmosphere obtained in
court. There were no jokes and no caricatures. People were
very quiet. Counsel for the prosecution put his searching
questions gravely and gently, almost with pitifulness;
counsel for the defence was careful, earnest, anxious. Progress
was slow, almost every word of the evidence had to
go down in the Judge's red book, to be written down in
Sir Christopher's neat precise handwriting. A man was on
trial for his life and, as afternoon darkened into evening,
the battle drew near its fateful issue.</p>

<p>He was a big, burly, stolid, honest-looking fellow, inarticulate,
not able to help himself by his answers or to take
proper advantage of the dexterous leads given him by his
counsel, who strained his right to lead since life was at stake.
In truth, though he was sorry that he had killed her&mdash;since
his old tenderness for her had revived, and moreover he
wished he had killed the other man instead&mdash;he could not
see that he had done wrong. He knew that the law said he
had, and drew therefrom a most formidable conclusion; but
he did not feel convicted in his own heart. She had deceived
him and, when discovered, had derided him with ugly words.
Had he slain her then and there in his rage, the plea of manslaughter
might well have prevailed. But he said nothing
to her; in grim silence he had taken his way to the town
and bought the knife, and waited for two days his opportunity;
then cunningly laid in wait where she would come
alone, and swiftly, in silence again, killed her. But may not
rage&mdash;ungovernable rage&mdash;last two days and be cunning?
Round this the battle raged. He had been cunning, calm,
methodical.</p>

<p>It was seven o'clock when the Judge finished his summing-up,
and the jury retired. His lordship did not leave the
court, but listened to an application relating to a civil cause
which was to be heard at the next town. Everybody seemed
to turn to this matter with relief; and small noises&mdash;coughs
and fidgetings&mdash;began to be audible again. But Mr. Williams
rose and went out noiselessly, soon to return. This time he
brought something from somewhere, and held it hidden
beneath the Bench.</p>

<p>The jury came back, and the little noises were all hushed.</p>

<p>"How say you&mdash;Guilty or Not Guilty?"</p>

<p>"Guilty," the foreman answered. "But we wish to
recommend him to mercy, my lord, in view of his great
provocation."</p>

<p>The prisoner's eyes turned slowly from the foreman to the
Judge. Mr. Williams slid what he had brought&mdash;the square
of black cloth&mdash;into the Marshal's hand, and, under the Bench
still, the Marshal gave it to the Judge.</p>

<p>The prisoner only shook his head in answer to the Clerk
of Assize's question whether he had any reason why the
Court should not pronounce sentence, and in due form
sentence followed. The Judge delivered it in low and very
gentle tones, with a high compassion. "The Jury's recommendation
will receive the fullest consideration, but I may
not bid you hope for mercy, save for that Mercy for which
everyone of us equally must pray."</p>

<p>At the end the condemned man made a little bow to the
Court, awkward but not without a pathetic dignity. "Thank
you, my lord," he said with respectful simplicity. Then he
was led downstairs, and the black square travelled back on
its hidden way to Mr. Williams' custody. Mr. Williams
stowed it in some invisible place, and issued his summons
to all and sundry to attend again at half-past ten on the
morrow. The Court rose; the work of the day was ended.
It remained only for the Marshal to write to His Majesty's
Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department,
apprising him that Sentence of Death had been passed and
that the Judge's notes would be sent to him without delay.
His Lordship, the Sheriff, and the Chaplain passed out to the
State carriage, attended by the Javelin-men.</p>

<p>"Do you think he's got any chance, my lord?" asked the
High Sheriff, as they drove to the Judge's lodgings.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Quintin, an off-chance, I should say. In fact
I think I shall help him, as far as I can&mdash;that's between
ourselves, of course. He didn't seem to me a bad sort of
man, but&mdash;" He smiled faintly&mdash;"very primitive! And
the poor wretch of a woman certainly didn't let him down
easy."</p>

<p>"I should like to have seen the other man in the dock
beside him, my lord," said the Chaplain.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, Chaplain, he wasn't bound to anticipate murder,
was he? As it is, he's thought it prudent to get out of the
country&mdash;at some loss and inconvenience, no doubt; this
man's friends were after him. But for that we should have
had him here to-day."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't have been popular," the High Sheriff opined,
with a shake of his glossy head.</p>

<p>Thus, as the days went by, at Raylesbury and the succeeding
Assize towns, drama after drama was unfolded, and varieties
of character revealed&mdash;knaves guileless and knaves quickwitted;
fools without balance or self-restraint; mere
animals&mdash;or such they seemed&mdash;doing animal deeds and
confronted with a human standard to which they were not
equal and which they regarded with a dull dismay. Incidentally
there came to light ways of life and modes of
thought astonishing, yet plainly accepted and related as
things normal; the old hands on the circuit knew all about
them and used their knowledge deftly in cross-examination.
Now and then the dock was filled by a figure that seemed
strange to it, by a denizen of the same world that Bench and
Bar, High Sheriff and Marshal inhabited; in one place there
was a solicitor who had been town-clerk and embezzled
public moneys; in another a local magistrate stood to plead
in the dock side by side with a labourer whom he himself
had committed for trial; the labourer was acquitted, and
the magistrate sent to prison&mdash;with nought to seek thence-forward
but oblivion. Freaks of destiny and whirligigs of
fortune! Yet these were the exception. The salient revelation
was of a great world of people to whom there was nothing
strange in finding themselves, their relatives or friends, in
that dock, to whom it was an accident that might well happen
to anybody, an incident in many a career. But they expected
the game to be played; they were keen on that, and bitterly
resented any sharp practice by the police; a "fair cop,"
on the other hand, begat no resentment. Lack of consideration
as between man and man, however, stirred ire.
One fellow's great grievance was that a zealous officer had
arrested him at seven o'clock on a Sunday morning. "Why
couldn't 'e let me 'ave my Sunday sleep out?" he demanded.
"A bloke's not going to do a bunk at seven on a Sunday
morning!" His lordship smilingly assured him that he
should have seven days less in prison, but he was not appeased.
"Seven of a Sunday, my lordship!" he growled still, in
disappearing.</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't like it myself," said "my lordship"
aside to the Marshal.</p>

<p>His lordship's "asides" added something to the Marshal's
instruction and more to his amusement. Sir Christopher was
not a reformer or a sociologist, nor even an emotionalist
either. He took this Assize Court world as he found it, just
as he took West-End drawing-rooms as he found them, at
other times of the year. He knew the standards. He was
never shocked, and nothing made him angry, except cruelty
or a Jack-in-office. In presence of these he was coldly
dangerous and deadly. To see him take in hand a policeman
whose zeal outran the truth was a lesson in the art of flaying
a man's skin off him strip by strip. The asides came often
then; the artist would have the pupil note his skill and did
not disdain his applause. Though the Marshal's share in the
work of the court was of the smallest, his lordship liked him
to be there, hearing the cases and qualifying himself for a
gossip over them, on an afternoon walk or at dinner in the
evening.</p>

<p>As the days went by, a pleasant intimacy between the old
man and the young established itself, and grew into a mutual
affection, quasi-paternal on the one side, almost filial on the
other. A bachelor, without near kindred save an elderly
maiden sister, the old Judge found in Arthur something of
what a son gives his father&mdash;a vicarious and yet personal
interest in the years to come&mdash;and he found amusement in
discovering likenesses between himself and his protÃ©gÃ©, or
at least in speculating on their existence with a playful
humour.</p>

<p>"Men differ in the way they look at their professions or
businesses," he said. "Of course everybody's got to live,
but, going deeper into it than that, you find one man to whom
his profession is, first and foremost, a ladder, and another to
whom it's a seat in the theatre&mdash;if you follow what I mean.
That fellow Norton Ward's of the first class. He's never
looking about him; his eyes are always turned upwards,
towards an inspiring vision of himself at the top. But you
and I like looking about us; we're not in a hurry to be always
on the upward move. The scene delights us, even though
we've no part in it, or only a small one. That's been true
about me, and I think it's true about you, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've my ambitions, sir," laughed Arthur. "Fits
of ambition, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Fits and starts? That's rather it, I fancy. You probably
won't go as far as Norton Ward in a professional way,
but you may very likely make just as much mark on life
really, besides enjoying it more; I mean in a richer broader
way. Purely professional success&mdash;and I include politics
as well as the law, because they're equally a profession to
men like our friend&mdash;is rather a narrow thing. The man
with more interests&mdash;the more human man&mdash;spreads himself
wider and is more felt really; he gets remembered more
too."</p>

<p>"The Idle Man's Apologia! Very ingenious!" said
Arthur, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, no, you shan't put that on me. It's perfectly true.
The greatest characters&mdash;I mean characters, not intellects&mdash;are
by no means generally in the highest places; because,
as I say, to climb up there you have to specialise too much.
You have to lop off the branches to make the trunk grow.
But I don't see you like that. The Burlington Theatre was
hardly in the direct line of ascent, was it?"</p>

<p>"I shan't be quite such a fool as that again, sir."</p>

<p>"Not to that extent, and not perhaps in just that way&mdash;no.
I don't know exactly how you came to go in for it;
indeed you don't quite seem to know yourself, as far as I can
gather from what you've said. But I take it that it was to
see and find out things&mdash;to broaden your life and your
world?"</p>

<p>Arthur hesitated. "Yes, I suppose so&mdash;complicated by&mdash;Well,
I was rather excited at the time. I was coming new to a
good many things."</p>

<p>Sir Christopher nodded his head, smiling. "You may
safely assume that Esther has gossiped to me about you.
Well now, take that lady&mdash;I don't mean Esther Norton
Ward, of course. Men like us appreciate her. Apart from
personal relations, she's something in the world to us&mdash;a
notable part of the show. So we what is called waste a lot
of time over her; she occupies us, and other women like her&mdash;though
there aren't many."</p>

<p>"No, by Jove, there are not!" Arthur assented.</p>

<p>"It's a lucky thing, Arthur, that your good cousin isn't
built on the lines of our friend at Raylesbury, isn't it? The
world would have been the poorer! By the way, that fellow's
going to get off; I had a note from Hurlstone's private
secretary this morning." Mr Hurlstone was the Home
Secretary. "It's a funny thing, but she kept coming into
my mind when I was trying the case."</p>

<p>Arthur's nod confessed to a similar experience.</p>

<p>"We didn't know each other well enough to talk about it
then," Sir Christopher observed, smiling. "Fancy if we'd
had to try Godfrey Lisle! I hope you're going to stick to
the Hilsey folk, Arthur? It's good for a man to have a
family anchorage. I haven't got one, and I miss it."</p>

<p>"Yes, rather! I shall go down there in the Christmas
vacation. I'm awfully fond of it."</p>

<p>The old man leant forward, warming his hands by the fire.
"You'll often find funny parallels like that coming into your
head, if you're ever a judge. Good thing too; it gives you
a broad view."</p>

<p>"I never shall be a judge," said Arthur, laughing.</p>

<p>"Very likely not, if they go on appointing the best lawyers.
Under that system, I should never have been one either."</p>

<p>"I think, on the whole, sir, that it's better fun to be a
Marshal."</p>

<p>Certainly it was very good fun&mdash;an existence full of change
and movement, richly peopled with various personalities.
From the Bar they lived rather apart, except for three or
four dinner-parties, but they entertained and were entertained
by local notables. The High Sheriffs themselves
afforded piquant contrasts. Bluff and glossy Sir Quintin,
the country gentleman, was one type. Another was the self-made
man, newly rich, proud of himself, but very nervous of
doing something wrong, and with stories in his mind of
judges savagely tenacious of their dignity and free with heavy
fines for any breach of etiquette: many an anxious question
from him about his lordship's likes and dislikes Arthur had
to answer. And once the office was ornamented by the son
and heir of a mighty Grandee, who did the thing most
splendidly in the matter of equipage and escort&mdash;even though
his liveries were only the family's "semi-state"&mdash;treated
his lordship with a deference even beyond the custom, and
dazzled Arthur, as they waited for Mr. Justice Lance (who
was sometimes late), with easy and unaffected anecdotes
of the youth of Princes with whom he had played in childhood&mdash;the
perfect man of the Great World, with all its graces.
Between this High Personage and the man who stole the pig
there ranged surely Entire Humanity!</p>

<p>But the most gracious impression&mdash;one that made its
abiding mark on memory&mdash;was more aloof from their work
and everyday experience. It was of an old man, tall and
thin, white-haired, very courtly, yet very simple and infinitely
gentle in manner. He was an old friend of Sir Christopher's,
a famous leader of his school of thought in the Church, and
now, after long years of labour, was passing the evening of his
days in the haven of his Deanery beneath the walls of a
stately Cathedral. They spent Sunday in the city, and,
after attending service, went to lunch with him. He knew
little of their work, and had never known much of the world
they moved in. But he knew the poor by his labours among
them, and the hearts of men by the strangely keen intuition
of holiness. There was no sanctimoniousness, no pursing-up
of lips or turning-away of eyes; on the contrary, a very
straight dealing with facts and reality. But all things were
seen by him in a light which suffused the Universe, in the
rays of a far-off yet surely dawning splendour; Sorrow endureth
for the night, but Joy cometh in the morning.</p>

<p>As they walked back to the Lodgings, Sir Christopher was
silent for awhile. Then he said abruptly: "That's a Saint!
I don't know that it's much use for most of us to try to be
saints&mdash;that's a matter of vocation, I think&mdash;but it does us
good to meet one sometimes, doesn't it? All that you and I
think&mdash;or, speaking for myself perhaps, used to think&mdash;so
wonderful, so interesting, has for him no importance&mdash;hardly
any real existence. It's at the most a sort of mist, or mirage,
or something of that sort&mdash;or a disease of mortal eyes&mdash;what
you like! Are you in any way a religious man?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid I'm not." He hesitated a moment and
went on: "I don't quite see how one can be, you know,
sir."</p>

<p>"Not as he is, no&mdash;I don't either. And I suppose the
world couldn't get on, as a working world, if by a miracle
everybody became like him. The world wants its own
children too&mdash;though no doubt it begets some devilishly
extreme specimens, as you and I have seen in the last few
weeks. Well, you'll probably make some sort of creed for
yourself presently&mdash;oh, a very provisional sketchy sort of
affair, I daresay, but still a bit better than club codes and
that kind of thing. And&mdash;&mdash;" He laid his hand on Arthur's
shoulder&mdash;"the beginning of it may just as well be this:
Earn your money honestly. Such work as you do get or
take, put your back into it."</p>

<p>"That after all is just what the Dean has done with his
job, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, so it is, though he doesn't do it for money&mdash;not
even money of his currency. Upon my word, I believe
he'd sooner be damned than let you or me be, if he could help
it! So I've shown you one more variety of human nature,
Arthur."</p>

<p>"It's at least as well worth seeing as any of the rest."</p>

<p>"Fit it in at leisure with your other specimens," Sir
Christopher recommended.</p>

<p>It did not seem altogether easy to follow this advice&mdash;even
after reflection.</p>

<p>But there had been other specimens, also not too easy to
fit in with one another or with any neat and compact scheme
of society, vindicating to complete satisfaction the ways of
God to men and of men to one another. No symmetrical
pattern emerged. Wherever he looked, life met his enquiring
eyes with a baffling but stimulating smile.</p>

<h2>START AND FINISH</h2>


<p>Whenever he was at home at the time of the
Assizes Lord Swarleigh made a point of inviting
the Judge to dinner. He was Lord-Lieutenant
of the County, and he considered the attention due from the
Military to the Civil Representative of the Crown. The
occasion was treated as one of ceremony, and though Sir
Christopher, in mercy to the horses and his own patience,
refused to drive the six hilly miles which lay between the
town and Higham Swarleigh Park in the state carriage, and
hired a car, he was in court dress; very refined and aristocratic
he looked.</p>

<p>"It's an enormous house, but distinctly ugly," he told the
Marshal as they drove along. "But they've got a lot of fine
things, and they're nice people. You'll enjoy yourself, I
think."</p>

<p>Presently the great house came dimly into view, its outline
picked out by the lights in the windows. It might be
ugly; it was certainly huge; it seemed to squat on the
country-side like a mighty toad. It had a tremendous air
of solidity, of permanence, of having been there from the
beginning of time, and of meaning to stay till the end, of
being part of the eternal order of things&mdash;rather like a secular
cathedral, with powdered footmen for beadles, and a groom
of the chambers for chief verger.</p>

<p>With courtly punctilio the Lord-Lieutenant received his
guest on the threshold, and himself led him to the State
drawing-room, where her Ladyship was waiting. The Marshal
followed behind, rather nervous, not knowing exactly
what his part might be in these dignified proceedings. The
Lord-Lieutenant was in full fig too, and several of the men
in uniform; the ladies were very sumptuous; the Bishop
of the diocese in his violet coat was a good touch in the
picture. Behind the hostess, as she received them, hung a
full-length portrait of His Majesty King George the Fourth
of happy memory, arrayed in the robes of the Garter; His
Majesty too was decorative, though in a more florid manner
than the Bishop.</p>

<p>Lord Swarleigh was not at all like his house, and anything
military about him was purely <i>ex officio</i>. He was a short
thin man with a grey beard, an antiquarian and something
of an historian. When he heard Arthur's name, he asked
what family of Lisles he belonged to, and when Arthur (with
accursed pride in his heart) answered "The Lisles of Hilsey,"
he nodded his head with intelligence and satisfaction. Lady
Swarleigh was not at all alarming either. She was a plump
middle-aged woman who had been pretty and wore her
clothes with an air, but her manner had a natural kindness and
simplicity which reminded Arthur of Esther Norton Ward's.
She handed him over to a pretty gay girl who stood beside
her. "Fanny, you look after Mr. Lisle," she commanded.
"He's to take you in, I think, but Alfred'll tell you about
that." Lady Fanny took possession of him in such a friendly
fashion that Arthur began to enjoy himself immediately.</p>

<p>He saw a tall handsome young fellow moving about the
room from man to man and briefly whispering to each; his
manner was calm and indolent, and his demeanour rather
haughty; he smiled condescendingly over something that the
Bishop whispered back to him with a hearty chuckle.</p>

<p>"Alfred Daynton's wonderful!" said Lady Fanny.
"He's papa's secretary, you know, though he really does all
mamma's work. He can send twenty couples in without a
list! He never mixes them up, and always knows the right
order."</p>

<p>The great Alfred came up. "You're all right," he said
briefly to Lady Fanny and Arthur, and gave a reassuring nod
to Lady Swarleigh herself. Then he looked at his watch, and
from it, expectantly, towards the doors. On the instant they
opened; dinner was ready. Alfred again nodded his head
just perceptibly and put his watch back in his pocket. He
turned to Lady Fanny. "You're at the pink table&mdash;on the
far side." He smiled dreamily as he added, "In the draught,
you know."</p>

<p>"Bother! You always put me there!"</p>

<p>"<i>Seniores priores</i>&mdash;and little girls last! Sorry for you,
Mr. Lisle, but you see you're on duty&mdash;and I've got to sit
there myself, moreover. And you'll have to talk to me,
because I haven't got a woman. I'm taking in the Chief
Constable&mdash;jolly, isn't it?"</p>

<p>However, at the pink table&mdash;where the host presided,
flanked by the High Sheriff's wife and the Bishop's wife&mdash;the
young folks in the draught got on very well, in spite of it;
and all their wants were most sedulously supplied.</p>

<p>"The thing in this house is to sit near Alfred," Lady
Fanny observed. "Papa and mamma may get nothing, but
you're all right by Alfred!"</p>

<p>"That's a good 'un!" chuckled the Chief Constable, a
stout old bachelor Major of ruddy aspect.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn,"
said Alfred, who appeared to be fond of proverbial expressions.</p>

<p>"You see, he engages and dismisses all the men," Lady
Fanny explained.</p>

<p>It struck Arthur that Lady Fanny and Alfred were in
truth remarkably good friends, and he was not wrong. In
the future among his own best friends he counted Mr. and
Lady Fanny Daynton, and Mr. Daynton turned his remarkable
powers of organisation to the service of the public. But
to-night Lady Fanny dutifully devoted herself to the Marshal,
and proved an intelligent as well as a gay companion.
Seeing his interest in his surroundings, she told him about
the pictures on the walls, the old silver ornaments on the
table, the armorial devices on the silver plates. "You see,
papa has drummed all the family history into us," she said,
in laughing apology for her little display of learning. "He
says people don't deserve to have old things if they don't
take an interest in them."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I should take only too much, if they were
mine. They appeal to me awfully." He added, smiling in
a burst of candour, with a little wave of his hands: "So
does all this!"</p>

<p>She considered what he said for a moment with a pretty
gravity, evidently understanding his words and gesture to
refer to the surroundings at large, the pomp and circumstance
in which it was her lot to live, to which he came as a stranger
and on which he looked with unaccustomed eyes; she liked
his frank admission that it was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>"I don't think it hurts," she said at last, "if you don't
take credit to yourself for it. You know what I mean? If
you don't think it makes you yourself different from other
people."</p>

<p>"But is that easy?" he asked in curiosity. "Isn't there
a subtle influence?"</p>

<p>"You're asking rather hard questions, Mr. Lisle!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I am, but I was thinking mainly of myself. I
associate other people with their surroundings and possessions
so much that I believe I should do the same with
myself. If I had a beautiful house, I should think myself
beautiful!"</p>

<p>"If you had this house, then, would you think yourself
a hideous giant?" she asked, laughing. "But how do you
mean about other people?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've got cousins who live in a fine old house&mdash;oh, not
a twentieth the size of this!&mdash;and I'm sure I like them better
because they've got a beautiful house. And the first time I
saw a very great friend she was in a very smart carriage; and
I'm sure she made a greater impression on me because of the
carriage. And I'm afraid that's being a snob, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She laughed again. "Well, don't think of us in connection
with our house, or you'll think of us as snails with shells too
large for them on their backs! No, I don't think you're a
snob, but I think you must beware of an Ã¦sthetic temperament.
It makes people rather soft sometimes, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>Before he had time to answer, Alfred cut in firmly: "Now
it's my turn, Lady Fanny!" He pointed with his thumb
to the Chief Constable's averted shoulder, and dropped his
voice to a whisper; "I've engineered him on to the Chaplain's
wife!" Arthur could not flatter himself that Lady
Fanny showed any annoyance at the interruption.</p>

<p>On the other side sat the Under-Sheriff&mdash;the supply of
ladies had quite given out&mdash;but the good man was not conversational,
and Arthur was left at leisure to look about him.
His eye fell on the small, thin, refined little host, sitting back
in his big arm-chair with an air of patient resignation, while two
large women&mdash;the Bishop's wife and the High Sheriff's wife&mdash;talked
to one another volubly across him. Perhaps even
being the local magnate was not all beer and skittles! If one
great man had admired "sustained stateliness of living"
another had seen in it a compatibility with every misfortune
save one&mdash;poverty. A compatibility obviously with boredom,
and probably with a great deal of it for a man like
Lord Swarleigh! A continuous annual round of it, always
between somebody's wives, wives of eminent persons and not
generally in their first youth&mdash;nor, on the other hand, interested
in the family history, nor in armorial bearings. Why
even he himself was better off; if he had the Under-Sheriff on
one side, he had youth and beauty on the other. Arthur
found himself being quite sorry for Lord Swarleigh, in spite
of Higham Swarleigh Park, the old silver, and George the
Fourth in the robes of the Garter. He had a vision of Godfrey
Lisle at one of Bernadette's fashionable parties. Godfrey had
got out of it all&mdash;at a price. Poor Lord Swarleigh would
never get out of it&mdash;till Death authoritatively relieved him
of his duties.</p>

<p>After dinner Lady Swarleigh signalled him, and made him
come and talk to her.</p>

<p>"We're always so glad when your Judge comes our circuit,"
she said. "He's a friend, you see, and that makes our
Assize dinner pleasanter. Though I always like it; lawyers
tell such good stories. Sir Christopher's very fond of you,
isn't he? Oh, yes, he's been talking a lot about you at dinner.
And he tells me you know Esther Norton Ward. Her mother
was at school with me, and I knew her when she was so high!
You must come and see us in London in the summer, won't
you? I wish the Judge and you could come out to dinner
again&mdash;just quietly, without all these people&mdash;but he tells me
you're moving on directly; so we must wait for London.
Now don't forget!"</p>

<p>Here was a woman to like, Arthur made up his mind instantly;
a regular good sort of woman she seemed to him,
a woman of the order of Marie Sarradet; ripened by life,
marriage, and motherhood, and, besides, amplified as it were
by a situation and surroundings which gave greater scope to
her powers and broader effect to her actions&mdash;yet in essence
the same kind of woman, straightforward, friendly, reliable.</p>

<p>"I've only one girl left at home," she went on, "and I
daresay I shan't keep her long, but the married ones are
always running in and out, and the boys too, and their boy
and girl friends. So you'll find lots of young people, and lots
of racketing going on. They often get up private theatricals
and inflict them on the patients at our hospital&mdash;my husband
is President of St. Benedict's, you know&mdash;and you ought to
be able to help us&mdash;with your experience!"</p>

<p>Arthur smiled and blushed. Sir Christopher had been
talking, it seemed; but apparently the talk had not done
him any harm in Lady Swarleigh's estimation.</p>

<p>"We shall be up after Easter. Don't forget!" she commanded
again, rising to meet the Judge as he came to take
leave of her.</p>

<p>With renewed ceremony, escorted by the Lord-Lieutenant,
with the High Sheriff, the Chaplain, the Under-Sheriff&mdash;last,
but certainly not least, Alfred&mdash;hovering in attendance, his
lordship and his satellite returned to their motor-car, the
satellite at least having thoroughly enjoyed his evening.</p>

<p>"What awfully jolly people they are!" he exclaimed,
thinking, plainly, of the ladies of the family; for the adjective
was not appropriate to Lord Swarleigh himself.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher nodded, smiling in amusement at Arthur's
enthusiasm, but very well pleased with it, and more pleased
with the hostess's whispered word of praise for his young
friend as she bade him good night.</p>

<p>"I got a piece of news to-night which I'm ashamed to say
I find myself considering bad," he said. "I thought I
wouldn't tell you before dinner, for fear that you'd think it
bad too, and so have your evening spoilt to some extent.
Horace Derwent writes that he's quite well again and would
like to join me for the rest of the circuit. And I can't very
well refuse to have him; he's been with me so often; and,
what's more, this'll be the last time. I'm going to retire at
Christmas."</p>

<p>"Retire! Why, you're not feeling out of sorts, are you,
sir? You seem wonderfully fit."</p>

<p>"I am. Wonderfully fit&mdash;to retire! I'm turned seventy
and I'm tired. And I'm not as quick as I was. When I sit
in the Divisional Court with a quick fellow&mdash;like Naresby, for
instance, a lad of forty-nine or so&mdash;I find it hard to keep up.
He's got hold of the point while I'm still putting on my
spectacles! It isn't always the point really, but that's
neither here nor there. So I'm going. They'll give me my
Right Honourable, I suppose, and I shall vanish becomingly."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry. I wanted to have a case before you
some day! Now I shan't. But, I say, they ought to make
you a peer. You're about the&mdash;well, the best-known judge
on the Bench."</p>

<p>Sir Christopher shook his head. "That's my rings, not
me," he said, smiling. "No, what's the use of a peerage to
me, even if it was offered? I'm not fit to sit in the Lords&mdash;not
enough of a lawyer&mdash;and I've no son. If you were my
son in the flesh, my dear boy, as I've rather come to think of
you in the spirit, these last weeks, I might ask for one for
your sake! But I've got only one thing left to do now&mdash;and
that's a thing a peerage can't help about."</p>

<p>Arthur was deeply touched, but found nothing to say.</p>

<p>"It's a funny thing to come to the end of it all," the old
man mused. "And to look back to the time when I was
where you are, and to remember what I expected&mdash;though,
by the way, that's hard to remember exactly! A lot of
work, a lot of nonsense! And to see what's become of the
other fellows too&mdash;who's sunk, and who's swum! Some of
the favourites have won, but a lot of outsiders! I was an
outsider myself; they used to tell me I should marry a rich
wife and chuck it. But I've never married a wife at all, and
I stuck to it. And the women too!"</p>

<p>Arthur knew that gossip, floating down the years, credited
Sir Christopher with adventures of the heart. But the old
man now shook his head gently and smiled rather ruefully.
"Very hard to get that back! It all seems somehow faded&mdash;the
colour gone out."</p>

<p>He lapsed into silence till they approached the end of their
drive. Then he roused himself from his reverie to say, "So
old Horace must come and see the end of me, and you and
I must say good-bye. Our jaunt's been very pleasant to me.
I think it has to you, hasn't it, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"It's been more than pleasant, sir. It's been somehow&mdash;I
don't quite know what to call it&mdash;broadening, perhaps.
I've spread out&mdash;didn't you call it that the other day?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Go on doing that. It enriches your life, though
it mayn't fill your pocket. Make acquaintances&mdash;friends in
different sets. Know all sorts of people. Go and see places.
No reason to give up the theatre even! Fill your store-house
against the time when you have to live on memory."</p>

<p>They reached the lodgings and went in together. Arthur
saw his Judge comfortably settled by the fire and supplied
with his tumbler of weak brandy and hot water before he
noticed a telegram, addressed to himself, lying on the table.
He opened and read it, and then came to Sir Christopher
and put it into his hands. "I think I should have had to ask
you to let me go anyhow&mdash;apart from Mr. Derwent."</p>

<p>Sir Christopher read: "Heavy brief come in from Wills
and Mayne coming on soon please return early as possible&mdash;Henry."</p>

<p>"Hum! That sounds like business. Who are Wills and
Mayne?"</p>

<p>"I haven't an idea. They gave me that County Court case
I told you about. But I don't in the least know why they
come to me."</p>

<p>"That's part of the fun of the dear old game. You can
never tell! I got a big case once by going to the races. Found
a fellow there who'd backed a winner and got very drunk.
He'd lost his hat and his scarf-pin before I arrived on the
scene, but I managed to save his watch, put him inside my
hansom, and brought him home. To show his gratitude, he
made his lawyers put me in a case he had. First and last, it
was worth four or five hundred guineas to me. I believe I'd
had a good deal of champagne too, which probably made
me very valiant! Well, you must go at once, as early as you
can to-morrow morning, and send a wire ahead&mdash;no, Williams
can telephone&mdash;to say you're coming. You mustn't take any
risks over this. It ought to be a real start for you." He
stretched out his hands before the fire. "Your start chimes
in with my finish!" He looked up at Arthur with a sly smile.
"How are the nerves going to be, if you run up against
Brother Pretyman in the course of this great case of yours?"</p>

<p>"I wish he was retiring, instead of you!" laughed Arthur.</p>

<p>"If you really know your case, he can't hurt you. You
may flounder a bit, but if you really know it you'll get it out
at last."</p>

<p>"I'm all right when once I get excited," said Arthur,
remembering Mr. Tiddes.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll be all right! Now go to bed. It's late, and
you must be stirring early to-morrow. I'll say good-bye
now&mdash;I'm not good at early hours."</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry it's over, and I don't know how to
thank you."</p>

<p>"Never mind that. You think of your brief. Be off with
you! I'll stay here a little while, and meditate over my
past sins." He held out his hand and Arthur took it. They
exchanged a long clasp. "The road's before you, Arthur.
God bless you!"</p>

<p>The old man sat on alone by the fire, but he did not think
of his bygone sins nor even of his bygone triumphs and
pleasures. He thought of the young man who had just left
him&mdash;his son in the spirit, as he had called him in a real
affection. He was planning now a great pleasure for himself.
He was not a rich man, for he had both spent and given
freely, but he would have his pension for life, quite enough
for his own wants, and after providing for the maiden sister,
and for all other claims on him, he would have a sum of eight
or ten thousand pounds free to dispose of. At his death, or on
Arthur's marriage&mdash;whichever first happened&mdash;Arthur should
have it. Meanwhile the intention should be his own pleasant
secret. He would say nothing about it, and he was sure that
Arthur had no idea of anything of the sort in his head. Let
the boy work now&mdash;with the spur of necessity pricking his
flank! "If I gave it him now, the rascal would take another
theatre, confound him!" said Sir Christopher to himself
with much amusement&mdash;and no small insight into his young
friend's character.</p>

<h2>WISDOM CONFOUNDED</h2>


<p>"Mr. Tracy Darton was in it, sir. He advised,
and drew the pleadings. But he got silk the
same time as we did" (Henry meant, as Mr.
Norton Ward did), "and now they've taken you in." Henry's
tone was one of admiring surprise. "And Sir Humphrey
Fynes is to lead Mr. Darton&mdash;they're sparing nothing! I
gather there's a good deal of feeling in the case. I've fixed a
conference for you, sir, at four-fifteen. There's one or two
points of evidence they want to consult you about."</p>

<p>Thus Henry to Arthur&mdash;with the "heavy brief" between
them on the table. Perhaps Henry's surprise and enthusiasm
had run away with him a little; or perhaps he had wanted to
make quite sure of lassoing Arthur back. At any rate, had
the brief been Norton Ward's, he would hardly have called it
"heavy"&mdash;satisfactory and, indeed, imposing as the fee
appeared in Arthur's eyes. Nor was the case what would
generally be known as a "heavy" one; no great commercial
transaction was involved, no half-a-million or so of
money depended on it. None the less, it already displayed
a fair bulk of papers&mdash;a voluminous correspondence&mdash;and
possessed, as Arthur was soon to discover, great potentialities
of further growth. A very grain of mustard seed for
that! It was destined, as luck would have it (the lawyers'
luck, not the clients'), to a notable career; it engaged the
attention of no less than ten of His Majesty's Judges. It
had already been before Pretyman, <span class="smcap">j</span>., in chambers.
Naresby, <span class="smcap">j</span>., was to try it (if a glance into the future be
allowable). The Court of Appeal was to send it back for a
new trial. The Lord Chief Justice was to take it to himself.
Again the Court of Appeal was to figure, disagreeing with
the judgment pronounced by the Lord Chief Justice on the
findings of the jury. And, at last, four noble and learned
Lords were to upset the Court of Appeal, and restore the
judgment of the Lord Chief Justice&mdash;a decision which, at all
events, was final, though Arthur, whose feelings were by that
time deeply engaged, never pretended to consider it right.
And then, when the case was disposed of for good and all,
no longer <i>sub judicibus</i> (the plural is obviously demanded),
the newspapers took a turn at it with those ironical comments
with which their ignorance is rashly prone to assail
the mysteries of the Law.</p>

<p>It&mdash;that is, the case of <i>Crewdson v. The Great Southern
Railway Company</i>&mdash;was about a dog, consigned according to
the plaintiff's&mdash;which was Arthur's&mdash;contention (the real
movements of the animal were wrapped in doubt from the
outset) by a certain Startin&mdash;who was at that date butler to
the plaintiff, but under notice to leave, and who did a few
days later vanish into space&mdash;to his mistress, Miss Crewdson,
an elderly lady of considerable means and of indomitable
temper&mdash;from Tenterden in Sussex to its owner at Harrogate,
where she was taking the waters. Though a very small dog,
it was a very precious one, both from a sentimental and from
a pecuniary point of view. So it ought to have been, considering
the questions of law and fact which it raised! For
in reply to Miss Crewdson's simple, but determined and
reiterated, demand for her dog or her damages, the Company
made answer, first, that they had never received the dog at
Tenterden, secondly that they had duly delivered the dog at
Harrogate, and lastly&mdash;but it was a "lastly" pregnant
with endless argument&mdash;that they had done all they were
bound to do in regard to the dog, whatever had in truth
happened or not happened to the animal. What actually
had, nobody ever knew for certain. A dog&mdash;some dog&mdash;got
to Harrogate in the end. The Company said this was Miss
Crewdson's dog, if they had ever carried a dog of hers at all;
Miss Crewdson indignantly repudiated it. And there, in the
end, the question of fact rested&mdash;for ever unsolved. The
House of Lords&mdash;though the Lord Chancellor, basing himself
on a comparison of photographs, did indulge in an <i>obiter
dictum</i> that the Harrogate dog, if it were not the Tenterden
dog, was as like as two peas to it ("Of course it was&mdash;both
Pekinese! But it wasn't our dog," Arthur muttered indignantly)&mdash;found
it unnecessary to decide this question, in
view of the fact that, Startin having disappeared into space,
there was no sufficient evidence to justify a jury in finding
that the Company had ever received any dog of Miss Crewdson's.
It was this little point of the eternally doubtful
identity of the Harrogate dog which proved such a godsend
to the wits of the Press; they suggested that the Highest
Tribunal in the Land might have taken its courage in both
hands and given, at all events for what it was worth, its
opinion about the Harrogate dog. Was he Hsien-Feng, or
wasn't he? But no. The House of Lords said it was unnecessary
to decide that. It was certainly extremely difficult, and
had given two juries an immensity of trouble.</p>

<p>All these remarkable developments, all these delightful
ramifications, now lay within the ambit of the red tape which
Arthur, left alone, feverishly untied. He had to be at it;
he could not wait. Not only was there the conference at four-fifteen,
but he was all of an itch to know what he was in for
and what he might hope for, divided between a craven fear of
difficulty above his powers and a soaring hope of opportunity
beyond his dreams.</p>

<p>After three hours' absorbed work he was still on the mere
fringe of the case, still in the early stages of that voluminous
correspondence, when Miss Crewdson was tolerably, and the
Company obsequiously, polite&mdash;and no dog at all was forthcoming,
to correspond to the dog alleged to have been consigned
from Tenterden. A dog was being hunted for all over
two railway systems; likely dogs had been sighted at Guildford,
at Peterborough, and at York. The letters stiffened
with the arrival of the Harrogate dog&mdash;ten days after the
proper date for the arrival of the dog from Tenterden. "Not
my dog," wrote Miss Crewdson positively, and added an
intimation that future correspondence should be addressed
to her solicitors. Messrs. Wills and Mayne took up the pen;
in their hands and in those of the Company's solicitors the
letters assumed a courteous but irrevocably hostile tone.
Meanwhile the unfortunate Harrogate dog was boarded out
at a veterinary surgeon's&mdash;his charges to abide the result of
the action; that doubt as to his identity would survive even
the result of the action was not then foreseen.</p>

<p>Arthur broke off for lunch with a tremendous sense of
interest, of zest, and of luck&mdash;above all, of luck. He had not
been called two years yet; he had no influential backing;
such a little while ago work had seemed so remote, in hours
of depression, indeed, so utterly out of the question. Then
the tiny glimmer of Mr. Tiddes, now the glowing rays of
<i>Crewdson v. The Great Southern Railway Company</i>! It was
not the moment, even if he had been the man, for a measured
sobriety of anticipation; it was one of those rare and rich
hours of youth when everything seems possible and no man's
lot is to be envied.</p>

<p>And he owed it to Wills and Mayne&mdash;unaccountably and
mysteriously still! The picture of old Mr. Mayne, with his
winking eye, rose before his mind. A strange incarnation of
Fortune! A very whimsical shape for a man's Chance to
present itself in! He gave up the mystery of how Mr. Mayne
had ever heard of him originally, but he hugged to his heart
the thought that he must have conducted the Tiddes case
with unexampled brilliancy. Only thus could he account
for Mr. Mayne's persistent loyalty.</p>

<p>So, after lunch, back to the dog&mdash;the Harrogate dog, that
Tichborne Claimant of a Pekinese dog!</p>

<p>Four o'clock struck. With a sudden return of fear, with
a desperate resolve to seem calm and not over-eager, Arthur
prepared to face Mr. Mayne. He wished to look as if cases like
<i>Crewdson v. The Great Southern Railway Company</i> were an
everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>Punctually at four-fifteen, a knock at the outer door&mdash;and
footsteps! Henry threw open the door of his room. "Mr.
Thomas Mayne to see you, sir." Henry's manner was very
important.</p>

<p>"Oh, show him in, please," said Arthur. It struck him,
with a sudden pang, that the bareness of his table was
glaringly horrible. Not even, as it chanced, any of Norton
Ward's briefs which, turned face-downwards, might have
dressed it to some degree of decency!</p>

<p>"This way, sir, please," said Henry, with his head over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>Timidly, rather apologetically, with a shy yet triumphant
smile on his melancholy face, Mr. Claud Beverley entered.</p>

<p>Instantaneously, at the mere sight of him, before Henry
had finished shutting the door, the truth flashed into Arthur's
mind, amazing yet supremely obvious; and his mind, thus
illuminated, perceived the meaning of things hitherto strange
and unaccountable&mdash;of Wills and Mayne's interest and
loyalty, of old Mr. Mayne's presence at the first night, of
Mr. Claud Beverley's promise to do him a good turn, no less
than of that budding author's bitter references to "the
office," which so hampered and confined the flight of his
genius. He had been so fierce, too, when Ayesha Layard
threatened to betray his identity! Arthur fell back into the
chair from which he had just risen to receive his visitor, and
burst into a fit of laughter&mdash;at Mr. Beverley, at himself, at
the way of the world and the twists of fortune. "By Jove,
it's you!" he spluttered out, in mirthful enjoyment of the
revelation.</p>

<p>Tom Mayne&mdash;such was he henceforth to be to Arthur, however
the world might best know him&mdash;advanced to the table
and&mdash;timidly still&mdash;sat down by it. "I swore to get it for you&mdash;and
I have! Tracy Darton's taking silk gave me the
chance. I had an awful job, though; the governor thought
you hadn't enough experience, and he was rather upset about
your being away&mdash;you remember that time? But I stuck
to him, and I brought him round. I managed it!"</p>

<p>In mirth and wonder Arthur forgot to pay his thanks.
"But why the deuce didn't you tell me, old man? Why
have you been playing this little game on me all this while?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I&mdash;I didn't know whether I could bring it off."
His timidity was giving way to gratification, as he saw what a
success his coup had with Arthur. "Besides I thought it was
rather&mdash;well, rather interesting and dramatic."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is&mdash;most uncommonly&mdash;both interesting and
dramatic," chuckled Arthur. "If you knew how I've
wondered who in the devil's name Wills and Mayne were!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just what I thought you'd be doing. That
was the fun of it!"</p>

<p>"And it turns out to be you! And I wondered why your
governor was at the first night!"</p>

<p>"I thought you might see him. I was rather afraid that
might give it away. But he insisted on coming."</p>

<p>"Give it away! Lord, no! It no more entered my head
than&mdash;&mdash;!" A simile failed him. "Did nobody know who
you were? Not Joe? Not the Sarradets?"</p>

<p>"None of them&mdash;except Ayesha Layard. She knew who I
was, because we once did a case for her."</p>

<p>Arthur was gazing at him now in an amusement which had
grown calmer but was still intense.</p>

<p>"Well, I was an ass!" he said softly. Then he remembered
what he ought to have done at first. "I say, I'm most
tremendously obliged to you, old fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, you came to the rescue. We were absolutely stuck
up for the rest of the money&mdash;couldn't go on without it,
and didn't know where to get it. Then you planked it down&mdash;and
I tell you I felt it! You gave me my chance, and I
made up my mind to give you one if I could. It's only your
being at the Bar that made it possible&mdash;and my being in the
office, of course."</p>

<p>"But it wasn't much of a chance I gave you, unfortunately."</p>

<p>"You mean because it was a failure? Oh, that makes no
difference. I was on the wrong tack. I say, Lisle, my new
play's fixed. We're rehearsing now. The Twentieth Society's
going to do it on Sunday week, and, if it's a go, they're going
to give me a week at Manchester. If that's all right, I ought
to get a London run, oughtn't I?" His voice was very eager
and excited. "If I do, and if it's a success"&mdash;(How the "Ifs"
accumulated!)&mdash;"I shall chuck the office!"</p>

<p>It was his old climax, his old hope, aspiration, vision.
Arthur heard it again, had heard him working up to it
through that procession of "Ifs," with a mixture of pity and
amusement. Would the new play do the trick, would "real
life" serve him better than the humours of farce? Would
that "success" ever come, or would all Tom Mayne's life
be a series of vain efforts to chuck an office ultimately
unchuckable, a long and futile striving to end his double
personality, and to be nobody but Claud Beverley? Full of
sympathy, Arthur wondered.</p>

<p>"It's bound to be a success, old chap. Here, have a
cigarette, and tell me something about it."</p>

<p>Eagerly responding to the invitation, the author plunged
into an animated sketch of his plot, a vivid picture of the
subtleties of his heroine's character and the dour influence of
her environment: the drama was realistic, be it remembered.
Arthur listened, nodding here and there, now murmuring
"Good!" now "By Jove!" now opening his eyes wide,
now smiling. "Oh, jolly good!" he exclaimed over the
situation at the end of the First Act.</p>

<p>Meanwhile <i>Crewdson v. The Great Southern Railway Company</i>
lay on the table between them, unheeded and forgotten. It
too, had it been animate, might have mused on the twists of
Fortune. This afternoon at least it might have expected to
hold the pride of place undisputed in Arthur Lisle's chambers!</p>

<p>But not until the scenario of the drama had been sketched
out to the very end, not until Arthur's murmurs of applause
died away, did Claud Beverley turn again into Tom Mayne.
And the transformation was woefully incomplete; for it
was with a sad falling-off in interest, indeed in a tone of deep
disgust, that he said, "Well, I suppose we must get back to
that beastly case!"</p>

<p>Arthur laughed again. What a way to talk of his precious
brief, pregnant with all those wonderful possibilities! What
an epithet for the barque that carried CÃ¦sar and his fortunes!
But his laugh had sympathy and understanding in it. Across
the narrow table sat another CÃ¦sar&mdash;and there was a barque
that carried his fortunes, and was to set sail within a short
space on a stormy and dangerous voyage, over a sea beset
with shoals.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, here's jolly good luck to <i>Jephthah's
Daughter</i>!" he said. Such was the title of Mr. Claud
Beverley's play of real life.</p>

<p>But when they did at last get back to the neglected case,
and Tom Mayne elbowed out Claud Beverley, a very good
head Tom showed himself to have, however melancholy again
its facial aspect. They wrestled with their points of evidence
for an hour, Arthur sending to borrow Norton Ward's
'Taylor,' and at the end Tom Mayne remarked grimly,
"That's a double conference, I think!"</p>

<p>"Some of it really belongs to <i>Jephthah's Daughter</i>," said
Arthur with a laugh.</p>

<p>"We may as well get something out of her, anyhow!"&mdash;and
Tom Mayne absolutely laughed.</p>

<p>Making an appointment to meet and dine, accepting an
invitation to come and see <i>Jephthah's Daughter</i>, full of thanks,
friendliness, and sympathetic hopes for the friend who had
done him such a good turn, inspired with the thought of the
work and the fight which lay before him&mdash;in fact, in a state of
gleeful excitement and goodwill towards the world at large,
Arthur accompanied his friend to the door and took leave of
him&mdash;indeed of both of him; gratitude to Tom Mayne,
hopes for Claud Beverley, were inextricably blended.</p>

<p>And it so fell out&mdash;what, indeed, was not capable of happening
to-day?&mdash;that, as his friend walked down the stairs
with a last wave of his arm, Mr. Norton Ward, <span class="smcap">k.c.</span>, walked up
them, on his return from a consultation with Sir Robert
Sharpe.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" he asked carelessly, as he went into
chambers, followed by Arthur, and they reached the place&mdash;half
room, half hall&mdash;which Henry and the boy (the Junior
Clerk was his own title for himself) inhabited.</p>

<p>"Only one of my clients," said Arthur, with assumed
grandeur, but unable to resist grinning broadly.</p>

<p>"One won't be able to get up one's own stairs for the
crowd, if you go on like this," observed Norton Ward. "Oh,
look here, Henry! I met Mr. Worthing&mdash;of the Great
Southern office, you know&mdash;over at Sir Robert's. There's
a case coming in from them to-night, and they want a consultation
at half-past five to-morrow. Just book it, will you?"</p>

<p>He turned to go into his own room.</p>

<p>But Arthur had lingered&mdash;and listened. "A case from
the Great Southern? Do you know what it's about?"</p>

<p>Norton Ward smiled&mdash;rather apologetically. He liked it to
be considered that he was in only really "heavy" cases now.
"Well, it's something about a dog, I believe, Arthur." He
added, "An uncommonly valuable dog, I'm told, though."</p>

<p>A valuable dog indeed&mdash;for one person in that room, anyhow!</p>

<p>"A dog!" cried Arthur. "Why, that's my case! I'm in
it!"</p>

<p>Norton Ward grinned; Arthur grinned; but most broadly
of all grinned Henry. Clerk's fees from both sides for Henry,
to say nothing of the dramatic interest of civil war, of domestic
struggle!</p>

<p>"Do you mean you're for the plaintiff? How in thunder
did you get hold of it?"</p>

<p>"That's my little secret," Arthur retorted triumphantly.
It was not necessary to tell all the world the train of events
which led up to his brief in <i>Crewdson v. The Great Southern
Railway Company</i>.</p>

<p>"Well, I congratulate you, old chap," said Norton Ward
heartily. Then he grinned again. "Come and dine to-morrow,
and we'll try to settle it."</p>

<p>"Settle it be&mdash;&mdash;! Not much!" said Arthur. "But I'll
dine all right."</p>

<p>Norton Ward went off into his room, laughing.</p>

<p>That was an awful idea&mdash;settling! Even though advanced
in jest, it had given him a little shock. But he felt pretty
safe. He had read Miss Crewdson's letters; she was most
emphatically not a settling woman! Her dog, her whole dog,
and nothing but her dog, was what Miss Crewdson wanted.</p>

<p>Arthur sat down before his fire and lit his pipe. He
abandoned himself to a gratified contemplation of the turn in
his fortunes. A great moment when a young man sees his
chosen profession actually opening before him, when dreams
and hopes crystallize into reality, when he plucks the first
fruit from branches which a little while ago seemed so far out
of reach! This moment it was now Arthur's to enjoy. And
there was more. For he was not only exulting; he was
smiling in a sly triumph. What young man does not smile in
his sleeve when the Wisdom of the Elders is confounded?
And what good-natured Elder will not smile with him&mdash;and
even clap his hands?</p>

<p>"It's my own fault if that thousand pounds I put in the
farce doesn't turn out the best investment of my life!"
thought Arthur.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

<h2>A NEW VISION</h2>


<p>It was not given to Arthur again to hear his mother's
voice or to see her alive. A few days after the first
round of the protracted battle over the great case had
ended in his favour, just before the close of the legal term,
news reached him of her death. She had been suffering from
a chill and had taken to her bed, but no immediate danger
was anticipated. She had read with keen pleasure Arthur's
letters, full now of a new zest for his work and a new confidence.
She breathed her gentle <i>Nunc Dimittis</i>; her daughter's
future was happily arranged, her son's now opened before
him. In simple and ardent faith her eyes turned to another
world. As though in answer to an appeal instinctively issuing
from her own soul, the end came very quickly. The tired
heart could bear no added strain. After making her comfortable
for the night, Anna had gone downstairs to eat her
own supper; when she came up again, all was over. There
was no sign of movement, no look of shock or pain; her eyes
were closed. It seemed that sleeping she had fallen asleep,
and her peaceful spirit found in an instant the eternal peace
of its faithful aspiration.</p>

<p>Here was no place for the bitterness of grief. Death brought
a quickened sense of unity and love, and the lost mother
joined her children's hands in a renewal of childhood's affection
and of sweet old memories. "Peace I leave with you,"
Anna whispered to Arthur as they stood beside the grave,
and he felt that she divined truly the legacy which their mother
would have chosen, before all others, to bequeath to them.</p>

<p>It was arranged that Anna should go and stay with Ronald
Slingsby's people until the time came for her wedding; it
was to take place in about three months. The old familiar
home was to be broken up. They spent two or three busy
days together, sorting out furniture, settling what was to be
sold and what either of them would like to keep; regretfully
deciding that this or that relic of old days was "rubbish"
and must be destroyed, redolent though it was with memories.
Many a sigh, many a laugh, the old things drew from them;
forgotten pass-words of childish intimacy came back to mind;
ancient squabbles were recalled with fond amusement. They
lived the old days over again together. The consciousness that
the old days were finally over, that their paths in life lay
henceforth far apart, gave added tenderness to recollection,
making this good-bye to the old house and the old things a
good-bye to the old days also&mdash;even in some sense a good-bye
to one another.</p>

<p>So it had to be, and so in truth it was best. They were not
made to live together. Differences now submerged beneath
the waves of a common love and a common emotion would
rise to the surface again, a menace to their love and peace.
Both knew it&mdash;was there not the memory of Arthur's former
visit to remind them?&mdash;and acquiesced in the separation
which their lots in life imposed. Yet with sadness. When
the actual moment came for leaving the old house and one
another, Anna threw herself into her brother's arms, sobbing.
"We mustn't quite forget one another, Arthur!"</p>

<p>"Please God, never, my dear," he answered gravely.
"We've shared too much together for that."</p>

<p>"You'll come to the wedding?" Her voice fell to a
whisper. "You'll be friends with Ronald?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, indeed I will. Why not?"</p>

<p>"He's not narrow or uncharitable really. It's only that
his standards are so high," she pleaded.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;and I hope mine'll get a little higher. Anyhow
we shall be jolly good friends, you'll see. Come, this isn't
really good-bye, Anna!"</p>

<p>She kissed him tenderly, whispering, "I shall pray for you
always, Arthur," and so turned from him to Ronald, who was
to escort her on her journey to his mother's house at Worcester.
Arthur left Malvern later in the same day, to spend
his Christmas at Hilsey.</p>

<p>He went from his old home to a new one; the manner of
his welcome assured him of that plainly. They were all&mdash;even
Godfrey&mdash;at the station to meet him. Their greetings, a little
subdued in deference to his sorrow, seemed full of gladness,
even of pride, that they should be there to soothe and soften
it, that he should have Hilsey to turn to, now that the links
with his old life were broken. When they got him to the
house, they shewed him, with exulting satisfaction, a new
feature, a surprise which Judith had conceived and Godfrey
gladly agreed in carrying out&mdash;a room, next to his old bedroom,
fitted up as a "den" for his exclusive use, artfully
supplied with all male appurtenances and comforts, a place
where he could be his own master, a visible sign that he was
no more a guest but a member of the household.</p>

<p>"Well, this is something like!" said Arthur, squeezing
Margaret's little hand in his and looking at Judith's eyes,
which shone with pleasure over the pretty surprise she had
contrived for him.</p>

<p>"You needn't be bothered with any of us more than you
want now," she told him.</p>

<p>"We're never to come in unless you invite us," Margaret
gravely assured him.</p>

<p>"A man's lost without his own room," Godfrey remarked;
and without doubt he spoke his true feelings.</p>

<p>"I take possession&mdash;and I'm not sure I shall let any of you
in!" Arthur declared gaily.</p>

<p>"Oh, me, sometimes?" implored Margaret.</p>

<p>"Well, you, sometimes&mdash;and perhaps one guinea-pig
occasionally!" he promised.</p>

<p>Only a few days before&mdash;while Arthur was still at Malvern&mdash;Godfrey's
case had been heard and had, of course, gone
through unopposed. He had performed his part in it with
that reserve of quiet dignity which was his in face of things
inevitable. Save for a formality&mdash;in this instance it was no
more&mdash;he and Bernadette were quit of one another. The new
state of things was definitely established, the family reconstituted
on a fresh basis. Little Margaret was now its centre,
her happiness and welfare its first preoccupation, the mainspring
of its life. No longer harassed by the sense of failure,
or afraid of a criticism none the less galling for being conveyed
in merry glances, Godfrey dared to respond openly to his
little girl's appeal for love. When the child, tutored by Judith's
skilful encouragement, made bold to storm the defences of
his study and beg his company, she met with a welcome shy
still but cordial, with a quiet affection which suited her own
youthful gravity. They would wander off together, or busy
themselves over Margaret's animals, neither of them saying
much&mdash;and what little they did say impersonal and matter-of-fact&mdash;yet
obviously content in their comradeship, liking to be
left to it, creating gradually, as the days went by, a little tranquil
world of their own, free from incursions and alarms, safe
from unexpected calls on them, from having to follow other
people's changing moods and adapt themselves to other
people's fitful emotions. The little maid grave beyond her
years&mdash;the timid man shrinking back from the exactions of
life&mdash;they seemed curiously near of an age together, strangely
alike in mind. Day by day they grew more sufficient for one
another&mdash;not less fond of Judith and of Arthur, but more
independent even of their help and company.</p>

<p>"Does she often ask about her mother&mdash;about whether
she's coming back, and so on?" Arthur enquired of Judith.</p>

<p>"Very seldom, and she's quite content if you say 'Not
yet.' But I think it'll be best to tell her the truth soon; then
she'll settle down to it&mdash;to tell her that her mother isn't coming
back, and isn't married to her father any more. You
know how easily children accept what they're told; they
don't know what's really involved, you see. By the time she's
old enough to understand, she'll quite have accepted the
position."</p>

<p>"But Bernadette will want to see her, won't she?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I really hope not&mdash;at present at all events.
You see what's happening now&mdash;Bernadette's just going out
of her life. Seeing her might stop that. And yet, if we look
at it honestly, isn't it the best thing that can happen?"</p>

<p>"In fact you want Bernadette completely&mdash;obliterated?"
He frowned a little. To make that their object seemed rather
ruthless. "A bit strong, isn't it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Can she complain? Isn't it really the logic of the situation?
With Bernadette what she is too&mdash;and the child what
she is!"</p>

<p>"You're always terribly good at facing facts, Judith." He
smiled. "A little weak in the idealising faculty!"</p>

<p>"In this family you've supplied that deficiency&mdash;amply."</p>

<p>"You musn't sneer at generous emotions. It's a bad
habit you've got."</p>

<p>She smiled, yet seemed to consider what he said. "I believe
it is a bad habit that I used to have. The old state of affairs
here rather encouraged it. So many emotions all at cross-purposes!
Rather a ridiculous waste of them! It made them
seem ridiculous themselves. But I think I've got out of the
habit."</p>

<p>"You've still a strong bias towards the mere matter-of-fact.
You like humdrum states of mind&mdash;I believe you
positively prefer them."</p>

<p>"And you like to pass from thrill to thrill!" She laughed.
"Is that very unfair? Because I don't mean it to be. And
I am changed a little, I think. What has happened here has
made a difference. Say you think me a little&mdash;just a little&mdash;softer?"</p>

<p>"Say you think me a little&mdash;just a little&mdash;harder?" he
retorted, mocking her.</p>

<p>"No, but seriously?" she persisted, fixing her eyes on him
almost anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well then, yes. I think you're perceptibly more human,"
he acknowledged, laughing still.</p>

<p>A more serious description of the change that Arthur found
in Judith might not have gone so near the mark. Though her
judgment preserved the sanity which he admired&mdash;without
emulation&mdash;and her manner the cool satiric touch which he
generally relished and sometimes resented, stress of circumstances
had broken down her detachment and forced her out
of her pose of critical but scarcely concerned spectator. She
had become, willy-nilly, involved in the family fortunes; she
could no longer merely look on, and smile, or deride; she had
been forced to think, to act, and to feel&mdash;to take a part, to
shoulder her share of the load. The latent faculties of her
nature, ripe to spring into full womanhood, had answered to the
call with instinctive readiness. So soon as there was work for
her courage, her love and sympathy, she had them to give, and
the more she gave the greater grew her store. Sustaining
Godfrey, mothering Margaret, she had experienced something
of the stirring and development of feeling which comes with
marriage and motherhood. Through disaster and consolation,
in ruin and the need to re-build, she had been forced
to seek the rich things of her heart and had found
abundance.</p>

<p>Thus she seemed 'perceptibly more human,' the change of
heart revealing itself not only in her dealings with others but
as surely, though more subtly, in herself. She opened out in
a new spontaneity of feeling; she was easier to approach in
confidence, more ready to appreciate and to share the joys of
the spirit. Even in her bearing and looks there might be
discerned a new alacrity, a new brightness of the eyes. Her
mirth was heartier and more kindly; her mockery had lost
its bitterness without losing its flavour.</p>

<p>Some such new, or revised, impression of her had formed
itself in Arthur's mind and found voice now in his bantering
speech. His gaze rested on her in pleasure as he added, "But
you needn't carry it too far. Nobody wants you to become
a gusher."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" she murmured. "I really think I'm
safe from that. I've too much native malice about me&mdash;and
it will out!"</p>

<p>"Perpetual founts of warm emotion&mdash;geysers! Terrible
people!"</p>

<p>"Oh, even you're hardly as bad as that!"</p>

<p>"They debase the emotional currency," said Arthur, with
a sudden and violent change of metaphor.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day hard weather set in, with a keen frost. A
few days of it promised skating on the low-lying meadows,
now under flood. Full of hope and joyful anticipation,
Arthur telegraphed for his skates.</p>

<p>"Can you skate? Have you got any skates? If you can't,
I'll teach you," he said excitedly to Judith.</p>

<p>"I have skates, and I can skate&mdash;thank you all the same,"
she replied, smiling demurely. "But you and I can teach
Margaret between us. I don't suppose Godfrey will care about
doing it."</p>

<p>The frost held, their hopes were realised. Godfrey's attitude
was what had been expected; with pathetic objurgations on
the weather he shut himself up in his study. The other three
sallied forth, though Margaret seemed alarmed and reluctant.</p>

<p>"I haven't skated for years," said Arthur, "but I used
rather to fancy myself."</p>

<p>"Well, you start, while I give Margaret a lesson."</p>

<p>Arthur was an average skater&mdash;perhaps a little above the
average of those who have been content to depend on the
scanty natural opportunities offered by the English climate.
He was master of the outside edge, and could manage a
"three," an "eight" and, in a rather wobbly fashion, a few
other simple figures. These he proceeded to execute, rather
"fancying himself" as he had confessed, while Judith held
Margaret in a firm grip and tried to direct her helplessly
slithering feet.</p>

<p>"I don't think I like skating," said Margaret, with her
usual mild firmness. "I can't stand up, and it makes my
ankles ache."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you're only just beginning, dear."</p>

<p>"I don't think I like it, Cousin Judith."</p>

<p>Judith's brows went up in humorous despair. "Just like
Godfrey!" she reflected helplessly. "Oh well, have a rest
now, while I put my skates on and show you how nice it will
be, when you've learnt how to do it."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall ever like it, Cousin Judith. I think
I shall go back and see what papa's doing."</p>

<p>Judith yielded. "Do as you like, Margaret," she said.
"Perhaps you'll try again to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps," Margaret conceded very doubtfully.</p>

<p>"The ice is splendid. Hurry up!" Arthur called.</p>

<p>But Judith did not hurry. After putting on her skates,
she sat on a hurdle for some minutes, watching Arthur's
evolutions with a thoughtful smile. He came to a stand
opposite to her, after performing the most difficult figure in
his repertory, his eyes and cheeks glowing and his breath
coming fast. "How's that for high?" he asked proudly.</p>

<p>"Not bad for a beginner," she replied composedly. "Would
you like really to learn to skate? Because, if you would, I'll
give you a lesson."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm hanged! Come on, and let's see what you can
do yourself!"</p>

<p>She got up and peeled off her jacket; before she put it
down on the hurdle, she produced an orange from the pocket
of it. Motioning Arthur to follow her, she glided gently to
the middle of the ice and dropped the orange on to it. Having
done this and given him a grave glance, she proceeded to
execute what was to him at least an inconceivably and
dazzlingly complicated figure. When it was at last achieved,
it landed her by his side, and she asked "How's that for
high?"</p>

<p>"You humbug! How dare you say nothing about it?
Letting me make a fool of myself like that! How did you
learn?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in Switzerland. I often went there in the winter&mdash;before
Hilsey claimed me. Come and try."</p>

<p>Arthur tried, but felt intolerably clumsy. His little skill
was vanity, his craft mere fumbling! Yet gradually something
seemed to impart itself from her to him&mdash;a dim inkling
of the real art of it, not the power to do as she did, but some
idea of why she had the power and of what he must do to gain
it. She herself seemed to be far beyond skill or art. She
seemed part of the ice&mdash;an emanation from it, a spirit-form
it gave out.</p>

<p>"Why, you must be a champion, Judith!"</p>

<p>"I just missed it, last year I was out," she answered. "I
think you show quite a knack."</p>

<p>"I've had enough. Give me an exibition!"</p>

<p>"Really?" He nodded, and she smiled in pleasure.
"I love it better than anything in the world," she said, as
she turned and darted away across the ice.</p>

<p>He sat down on the hurdle, and smoked his pipe while he
watched her. He could see her glowing cheeks, her eyes
gleaming with pleasure, her confident enraptured smile&mdash;above
all, the graceful daring turns and twists of her slim
figure, so full of life, of suppleness, of the beauty of perfect
balance and of motion faultlessly controlled&mdash;all sign of
effort hidden by consummate mastery. She was grace triumphant,
and the triumph irradiated her whole being&mdash;her
whole self&mdash;with a rare fine exhilaration; it infected the onlooker
and set his blood tingling through his veins in sympathetic
exultation.</p>

<p>At last she came to a stop opposite to him&mdash;cheeks red,
eyes shining, chest heaving, still full of that wonderful motion
waiting to be loosed again at the bidding of her will.</p>

<p>"I never saw anything like it!" he cried. "You're beautiful,
beautiful, Judith!"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;it's beautiful," she laughed, her cheeks
flushing to a more vivid red.</p>

<p>"I meant what I said," he persisted almost indignantly.
"Beautiful!"</p>

<p>She did not try to conceal her pleasure and pride. "I'm
glad, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Look here, you've got to teach me how to do it&mdash;some of
it, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I will, if the frost will only last. Let's pray to heaven!"</p>

<p>"And you've got to come to Switzerland with me next
winter."</p>

<p>"I'll think about that!"</p>

<p>"In fact every winter&mdash;if you'll kindly think about that
too!" He got up with a merry ringing laugh. "God bless
the frost! Let's have another shot at waltzing? You've
inspired me&mdash;I believe I shall do it better!"</p>

<p>He did it&mdash;a little better&mdash;and she ardently encouraged
him; the slender supple strength of her figure resting against
his arm seemed a help more than physical, almost, as he said,
an inspiration. Yet presently he stopped, and would have
her skate by herself again.</p>

<p>"No, that's enough for this morning," she protested. Yet,
when he begged, she could not but do as he asked once more;
his praises fell so sweet on her ears. At the end she glided
to him and held out her hands, putting them in his. "No
more, no more! I&mdash;I feel too excited!"</p>

<p>"So do I, somehow," he said, laughing, as he clasped her
hands, and their eyes met in exultant joyfulness. "You've
given me a new vision of you, Judith!"</p>

<h2>THE LINES OF LIFE</h2>


<p>The glorious frost lasted a glorious week, generous
measure for an English frost, and long enough for
Arthur to make considerable improvement in the
art of skating; since Margaret maintained her attitude of
not caring about it, he had the benefit of the professor's
undivided attention. Long enough too it lasted for the new
vision to stamp itself deep on his mind. For companion
picture he recalled from memory another, which at the outset
had made no such vivid impression&mdash;Judith crying over
the failure of the farce. His mind had passed it by lightly
when it was first presented to him; it had not availed to turn
his amused thoughts from Miss Ayesha Layard and her
medicine. It came back now, at first by what seemed only
a chance or freak of memory, but presently establishing for
itself a relation with its sister-vision of triumphant grace.
Between them they gave to Judith in his eyes something
that he had not discerned before&mdash;something which had
always been there, though not in such full measure in the
earlier days of their acquaintance, before disaster and grief,
and love and sympathy, had wrought upon her spirit. He
saw her now&mdash;he was idealising again, no doubt, to some
degree, after that generous fashion of his which no cold steel
of experience could quite eradicate&mdash;as capable of the depths
and heights of emotion; no longer as tethered too tight by
reason and good sense, somewhat too critical, a trifle too
humdrum in her notions&mdash;that was the conception of her
which he had in the days of Bernadette's reign. The solid
merits of that type he left to her still; and in this he was
indeed on the firm ground of experience; he had tried and
tested them. But now he decked them with bright ornaments
and blended their sober useful tints with richer colouring&mdash;with
tenderness of heart, a high brave joy in life, the
grace of form and charm of face in which the eye delights.</p>

<p>Subtly and delightfully sure of his changed vision of her,
she dared now to be wholly herself with him, to maintain no
shy reserves where prudence held pleasure in bondage, and
affection took refuge from the fear of indifference. She
borrowed of him too, though this unconsciously, in an
instinct to adapt herself to him. As she had lent to him
from her stores of fortitude and clear-sightedness, she levied
toll for herself on his wealth of persistent and elastic cheerfulness,
his gust for life and all that life brings with it.</p>

<p>Yet her old self was not eclipsed nor wholly transformed.
Her caution remained, and her healthy distrust of sudden
impulses. The satiric smile was still on her lips, to check
transports and cool the glow of fascination. She had been so
wont to think him Bernadette's man&mdash;whether in joy or in
delusion, or in the cruel shock of sudden enlightenment&mdash;so
wont to think Bernadette invincible, that even Bernadette's
memory seemed a thing that could hardly be displaced.
She craved a probation, a searching test both of her own
feelings and of Arthur's. She feared while she enjoyed, and
of set purpose nursed her doubts. There was not always
skating&mdash;not always bright sun, keen air, and the rapture
of motion, incentives to hot blood. If he deluded himself,
she would have compassion ready and friendship for him
unimpaired; but if she, with open eyes, walked into a trap,
her judgment of herself would be bitter, and friendship
would scarcely stand against the shame.</p>

<p>Arthur went back to town ten days before the Christmas
vacation ended, to look after his work and, incidentally, to
attend Marie Sarradet's wedding. He left Hilsey cheerfully,
with no real sense of a parting or of separation. He was still
keen and excited about his work, about the life that seemed
now to lie before him in the law, and Hilsey&mdash;with all it
meant to him&mdash;figured no longer as a distraction from that
life, or even an enemy to it, but rather as its background and
complement, so much a part of it as to seem with him while
he worked. And so it was with Judith herself&mdash;the new
Judith of the new vision. She was no enemy to work either.
However bedecked and glorified, she was still Judith of the
cool head and humorous eyes, the foe of extravagance and
vain conceits.</p>

<p>"Back to my dog!" he said gaily. "Holding on to his
tail, I'll climb the heights of fortune! And I hope one or
two more will find their way to chambers&mdash;some little
puppies, at all events."</p>

<p>"Ambition is awake! I seem to see a dawning likeness to
Mr. Norton Ward."</p>

<p>"I seem to see, as in a golden dream, enough to pay his
rent, confound him!"</p>

<p>"I discern, as it were from afar off, a silk gown gracefully
hanging about your person!"</p>

<p>"I discern money in my pocket to pay a railway fare to
Switzerland!"</p>

<p>"There rises before my eyes a portly man in a high seat!
He administers Justice!"</p>

<p>"Before mine, a lady, gracious and ample, who&mdash;&mdash;"
But that final vision was promptly dispelled by a cushion
which Judith hurled at him with unerring aim.</p>

<p>Marie Sarradet and Sidney Barslow were married at Marylebone
Church, and after the ceremony there was a gathering
of old friends at the house in Regent's Park&mdash;the family
(including Mrs. Veltheim), Amabel Osling, Mildred Quain,
Joe Halliday, and Mr. Claud Beverley, the last-named (and
so named still in the Sarradet circle) blushing under congratulations;
for the drama of real life had met with a critical
success, though the London run had not as yet followed.
Indeed, as befitted the occasion, a sense of congratulation
pervaded the air. It seemed as though more than a wedding
were celebrated. They toasted in their champagne the
restored stability of the family and the business also. The
bridegroom, Managing Director of Sarradet's Limited,
showed signs of growing stout; there was a very solid
settled look about him; order, respectability, and a comfortable
balance at the bank were the suggestions his appearance
carried. Far, far in the past the rowdy gaieties of
Oxford Street! Old Sarradet basked in the sun of recovered
safety and tranquillity. Even Raymond, still nominally
"on appro," used, all unrebuked, such airs of possession
towards Amabel that none could doubt his speedy acceptance.
Marie herself was in a serene content which not even the
presence of her aunt could cloud. She greeted Arthur with
affectionate friendship.</p>

<p>"It is good of you to come. It wouldn't have seemed
right without you," she told him, when they got a few words
apart.</p>

<p>"I had to come. You don't know how glad I am of your
happiness, Marie."</p>

<p>She looked at him frankly, smiling in a confidential meaning.
"Yes, I think I do. We've been very great friends,
haven't we? And we will be. Yes, I am happy. It's all
worked in so well, and Sidney is so good to me." She blushed
a little as she added, with frank simplicity, "I love him,
Arthur."</p>

<p>He knew why she told him; it was that no shadow of self-reproach
should remain with him. He pressed her hand
gently. "God bless you, and send you every happiness!"</p>

<p>She lowered her voice. "And you? Because I've a right
to wish you happiness too."</p>

<p>"Fretting about me! And on your wedding day!" he
rebuked her gaily.</p>

<p>"Yes, just a little," she acknowledged, laughing.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't. No, honestly you needn't." He
laughed too. "I'm shamefully jolly!"</p>

<p>"Then it's all perfect," she said with a sigh of contentment.</p>

<p>Arthur had missed seeing <i>Jephthah's Daughter</i> owing to
his mother's death, but since not having seen or read the
work is not always a disadvantage when congratulations
have to be offered to the author, he expressed his heartily to
Mr. Beverley. "Next time it's put up, I shall be there,"
he added.</p>

<p>"I don't know that it ever will be&mdash;and I don't much care
if it isn't. It's not bad in its way&mdash;you've seen some of the
notices, I daresay?&mdash;but I'm not sure that it's my real line.
I'm having a shot at something rather different. If it
succeeds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Arthur knew what was coming. "You shan't chuck the
office before we've found the dog, anyhow!" he interrupted,
laughing. But none the less he admired the sanguine genius.
"Only there won't be enough 'lines' to last him out at this
rate," he reflected.</p>

<p>At the end&mdash;when bride and bridegroom had driven off&mdash;Arthur
suddenly found his hand seized and violently shaken
by old Mr. Sarradet, who was in a state of excited rapture.
"The happiest day of my life!" he was saying. "What I've
always hoped for! Always, Mr. Lisle, from the beginning!"</p>

<p>He seemed to have no recollection of a certain interview in
Bloomsbury Street&mdash;an interview abruptly cut short by the
arrival of a lady in a barouche. He was growing old, his
memory played him tricks. He had found a strong arm to
lean on and, rejoicing in it, forgot that it had not always
been the thing which he desired.</p>

<p>"Yes, you know a good thing when you see it, Mr. Sarradet,"
Arthur smilingly told the proud old man. But he
did it with an amused consciousness that Mrs. Veltheim,
who stood by, eyeing him rather sourly, had a very clear
remembrance of past events.</p>

<p>"We'll give 'em a dinner when they come back. You
must come, Mr. Lisle. Everybody here must come," old
Sarradet went on, and shuffled round the room, asking everyone
to come to the dinner. "And now, one more glass of
champagne! Oh yes, you must! Yes, you too, Amabel&mdash;and
you, Mildred! Come, girls, a little drop! Here's a
health to the Happy Pair and to Sarradet's Limited!"</p>

<p>"The Happy Pair and Sarradet's Limited!" repeated
everybody before they drank.</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> Sarradet's Limited!" reiterated the old man,
taking a second gulp.</p>

<p>"I don't know when he'll stop," whispered Joe Halliday.</p>

<p>"If we don't want to get screwed, we'd better make a bolt
of it, Arthur."</p>

<p>So they did, and went for a stroll in the Park to cool their
heads.</p>

<p>"Well, that's good-bye to them!" said Joe, when he had
lit his cigar. "And it's good-bye to me for a bit too. I'm
sailing the day after to-morrow. Going to Canada."</p>

<p>"Are you? Rather sudden, isn't it? Going to be gone
long?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Just as things turn out. I may be back in
a couple of months; I may not turn up again till I'm a
Colonial Premier or something of that sort. The fact is, I've
got into no end of a good thing out there. A cert.&mdash;well,
practically a cert. I wish I'd been able to put you in for a
thou. or two, old fellow."</p>

<p>"No, thanks! No, thanks!" exclaimed Arthur, laughing.</p>

<p>"But it wasn't to be done. All I could do to get in myself!
Especially as I'm pretty rocky. However they wanted
my experience&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of Canada? Have you ever been there?"</p>

<p>"I suppose Canada's much like other places," said Joe,
evading the direct question. "It's my experience of business
they wanted, of course, you old fool. I'm in for a good thing
this time, and no mistake! If I hadn't had too much fizz
already, I'd ask you to come and drink my health."</p>

<p>"Good luck anyhow, old fellow! I'm sorry you're going
away, though. I shan't enjoy seeing Trixie Kayper half as
much without you."</p>

<p>Joe suddenly put his arm in Arthur's. "You're a bit of
a fool in some ways, in my humble judgment," he said.
"But you're a good chap, Arthur. You stick to your pals,
you don't squeal when you drop your money, and you don't
put on side. As this rotten old world goes, you're not a bad
chap."</p>

<p>"This sounds like a parting testimonial, Joe!"</p>

<p>"Well, what if it does? God knows when we shall eat a
steak and drink a pot of beer together again! A good loser
makes a good winner, and you'll be a winner yet. And
damned glad I shall be to see it! Now I must toddle&mdash;get in
the Tube and go to the City. Good-bye, Arthur."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Joe. I say, I'm glad we did <i>Did You Say
Mrs.?</i> Perhaps you'll run up against Ayesha Layard over
there. Give her my love."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang the girl! I don't want to see her! So long
then, old chap!" With a final grip he turned and walked
away quickly.</p>

<p>Arthur saw him go with a keen pang of regret. They had
tempted fortune together, and each had liked what he found
in the other. Joe's equal mind&mdash;which smiled back when
the world smiled, and, when it frowned, thought a cheerful
word of abuse notice enough to take of its tantrums&mdash;made
him a good comrade, a good stand-by; his humour, crude
though it was and pre-eminently of the market-place, put
an easier face on trying situations. He had a faithful, if
critical, affection for his friends, and Arthur was not so rich
in friends as to lose the society of one like this without sorrow.
As it chanced, his intimates of school and university days had
drifted into other places and other occupations which prevented
them from being frequent companions, and he had
as yet not replaced them from the ranks of his profession,
from among the men he met in the courts and in the Temple;
up to now courts and Temple had been too much places to
get away from, too little the scene of his spare hours and his
real interests, to breed intimacies, though, of course, they
had produced acquaintances. As he walked down to the
Temple now, after parting from Joe Halliday&mdash;and for how
long Heaven alone could tell!&mdash;he felt lonely and told himself
that he must get to know better the men among whom
his life was cast. He found himself thinking of his life in the
Temple as something definitely settled at last, not as a
provisional sort of arrangement which might go on or,
on the other hand, might be ended any day and on any
impulse. The coils of his destiny had begun to wind about
him.</p>

<p>It was vacation still, and chambers were deserted; Henry
and the boy departed at four o'clock in vacation. He let himself
in with his key, lit his fire, induced a blaze in it, and
sat down for a smoke before it. Marie Sarradet came back
into his mind now&mdash;Marie Barslow; the new name set him
smiling, recalling, wondering. How if the new name had
not been Barslow but another? Would that have meant
being the prop of the family and the business, being engulfed
in Sarradet's Limited? That was what it meant for Sidney
Barslow&mdash;among other things, of course. But who could
tell what things might mean? Suppose the great farce had
succeeded, had really been a gold mine&mdash;of the sort with gold
in it&mdash;really a second <i>Help Me out Quickly!</i> Where would
he be now&mdash;he and his thousands of pounds&mdash;if that had
happened? Would he have been producing more farces,
and giving more engagements to infectious Ayesha Layard
and indefatigable Willie Spring?</p>

<p><i>Dis aliter visum</i>&mdash;Fate decreed otherwise. Detached from
the fortunes of Sarradet's Limited, rudely&mdash;indeed very
rudely&mdash;repulsed from the threshold of theatrical venture,
he had come back to his Legitimate Mistress. He knew her
ways&mdash;her rebuffs, her neglect, her intolerable procrastination;
but he had enjoyed just a taste of her favour and
attractions too&mdash;of the interest and excitement, of the many-sided
view of life, that she could give. Because of these,
and also because of her high dignity and great traditions&mdash;things
in which Sarradet's Limited and theatrical ventures
seemed to him not so rich&mdash;he made up his mind to follow
the beckoning of fate's finger and to stick to her, even though
she half-starved him, and tried him to the extreme limit of
his patience&mdash;after her ancient wont.</p>

<p>But his renewed allegiance was to be on terms; so at least
he tried to pledge the future. He did not want his whole life
and thought swallowed up. Here his own temperament had
much to say, but his talks with Sir Christopher a good deal
also. He would not be a sleuth-hound on the track of success
(a Norton Ward, as he defined it to himself privily), nose to
the ground, awake to that scent only, with no eyes for the
world about him&mdash;or again, as it might be put, he would not
have his life just a ladder, a climb up the steep side of a cliff,
in hope of an eminence dizzy and uncertain enough even if
he got there, and with a handsome probability of tumbling
into the tomb half-way up. Could terms be made with the
exacting Mistress about this? Really he did not know. So
often she either refused all favours or stifled a man under the
sheer weight of them. That was her way. Still, Sir Christopher
had dodged it.</p>

<p>Suddenly he fell to laughing over the ridiculousness of
these meditations. Afraid of too much work, when but for
that dog he was briefless still! Could there be greater
absurdity or grosser vanity? Yet the idea stuck&mdash;thanks
perhaps to Sir Christopher&mdash;and under its apparent inanity
possessed a solid basis. There was not only a career which he
wished to run; there was a sort of man that he wanted to
be, a man with broad interests and far-reaching sympathies,
in full touch with the varieties of life, and not starved of its
pleasures. Thus hazily, with smiles to mock his dreams,
in that quiet hour he outlined the future of his choice, the
manner of man that he would be.</p>

<p>The ringing of the telephone bell recalled him sharply to
the present. With a last smiling "Rot!" muttered under
his breath at himself, with a quick flash of hope that it was
Wills and Mayne again, he went to answer the call. A strange
voice with a foreign accent enquired his number, then asked
if Mr. Arthur Lisle were in, and, on being told that it was
that gentleman who was speaking, begged him to hold the
line. The next moment another voice, not strange at all
though it seemed long since he had heard it, asked, "Is that
you, Cousin Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me," he answered, with a sudden twinge of
excitement.</p>

<p>"I'm at the Lancaster&mdash;over here on business with the
lawyers, just for a day or two. Oliver's in Paris. I want to
see you about something, but I hardly hoped to find you in
town. I thought you'd be at Hilsey. How lucky! Can you
come and see me some time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, any time. I can come now, if you like. I'm doing
nothing here."</p>

<p>A slight pause&mdash;Then&mdash;"Are you alone there, or is Frank
Norton Ward there too?"</p>

<p>"There's absolutely nobody here but me."</p>

<p>"Then I think I'll come and see you. It's only a step.
Will you look out for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll be looking out for you."</p>

<p>"In about a quarter of an hour then. Good-bye."</p>

<p>Arthur hung up the receiver and returned to his room&mdash;the
telephone was in Henry's nondescript apartment. A
smile quivered about his lips; he did not sit down again,
but paced to and fro in a restless way. Strange to hear her
voice, strange that she should turn up to-day! Of all the
things he had been thinking about, he had not been thinking
of her. She recalled herself now with all the effectiveness of
the unexpected. She came suddenly out of the past and
plunged him back into it with her "Cousin Arthur." He felt
bewildered, yet definitely glad of one thing&mdash;a small one to
all seeming, but to him comforting. He was relieved that
she was coming to chambers, that he would not have to go to
the Lancaster, and ask for her with proper indifference;
ask for her by an unfamiliar name&mdash;at least he supposed she
used that name! He felt certain that he would have blushed
ridiculously if he had had to ask for her by that name. He
nodded his head in relief; he was well out of that anyhow!
And&mdash;she would be here directly!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>

<h2>HILSEY AND ITS FUGITIVE</h2>


<p>She met him just as of old; she gave him the same
gay, gracious, almost caressing welcome when she
found him at the foot of the stairs, awaiting her
arrival and ready to escort her to his room. She put her arm
through his and let him lead her there; then seated herself
by the fire and, peeling off her gloves, looked up at him as he
stood leaning his arm on the mantelpiece. She smiled as
she used; she was the same Bernadette in her simple cordiality,
the same too in her quiet sumptuousness. Only in
her eyes, as they rested on his face, he thought he saw a
new expression, a look of question, a half-humorous apprehension,
which seemed to say, "How are you going to treat
me, Cousin Arthur?" Not penitence, nor apology, but just
an admission that he might have his own views about her
and might treat her accordingly. "Tell me your views then&mdash;let's
know how we stand towards one another!"</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because some such doubt found a place in
her mind that she turned promptly, and in a rather business-like
way, to the practical object of her visit.</p>

<p>"I came over to see my lawyers about the money question.
They wanted to see me, and convince me I ought to take
something from Godfrey. I don't know that I should refuse
if I needed it, but I don't. You know what lawyers are!
They told me Oliver would desert me, or practically said he
would! Well, I said I was going to chance that&mdash;as a fact
he's settling quite a lot on me&mdash;and at last they gave in,
though they were really sulky about it. Then they told me
that I ought to settle something about Margaret. Godfrey's
been very kind there too; he's offered to let me see her
practically whenever I like&mdash;with just one condition, a
natural one, I suppose." She paused for a moment and now
leant forward, looking into the fire. "I shouldn't have
quarrelled with that condition. I couldn't. Of course he
wouldn't want her to see Oliver." She frowned a little. "I
told the lawyers that the matter wasn't pressing, as I was
going abroad, for a year probably, perhaps longer; it could
wait till I got back."</p>

<p>"You're going away?" asked Arthur, without much
seeming interest.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;to Brazil. Oliver's got some interests there to
look after." She smiled. "I daresay you think it happens
rather conveniently? So it does, perhaps&mdash;but I think he'd
have had to go anyhow; and of course I mean to go with
him. But about Margaret. The real truth is, I didn't want
to talk about her to the lawyers; I couldn't tell them what
I really felt. I want to tell you, Arthur, if I can, and I want
you somehow to let Godfrey know about it&mdash;and Judith too.
That's what I want you to do for me. Will you?"</p>

<p>"I'll do my best. He won't like talking about it. He may
be very unapproachable."</p>

<p>"I know he may!" She smiled again. "But you'll try,
won't you?" She looked up at him gravely now, and rather
as though she were asking his judgment. "I'm not going
to see her, Arthur."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;not at all? Never?" he asked slowly.</p>

<p>"It was always rather difficult for Margaret and me to get
on together, even before all that's happened. We didn't
make real friends. How could we now&mdash;with sort of official
visits like those? Under conditions! Still, that's not the
main thing; that's not what I want you to say to Godfrey.
I don't mean to see her till she's old enough&mdash;fully old enough&mdash;to
understand what it all means. Then, when she's heard
about it&mdash;not from me, I don't want to make a case with
her or to try to justify myself&mdash;when Godfrey, or Judith, or
even you, have told her, I want it to be left to her what to do.
If she likes to leave it alone, very good. If she likes to see
me, and see if we can make friends, I shall be ready. There'll
be no concealment then, no false pretences, nothing to
puzzle her. Only just what sort of a view she takes of me
herself, when she's old enough." She paused and then asked,
"Have they told her anything yet?"</p>

<p>"Only that you can't come back yet. But I think they
mean to tell her presently that you won't, that&mdash;well, that
it's all over, you know. Judith thinks she'll accept that as
quite&mdash;well, that she won't see anything very extraordinary
about it&mdash;won't know what it means, you see."</p>

<p>"Do you think she misses me much?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so. She and her father are becoming
very great friends. I think she's happy."</p>

<p>"You've been there a lot?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a good deal."</p>

<p>"I saw your mother's death in the paper. I'm sorry,
Arthur."</p>

<p>"They make me quite at home at Hilsey. They've given
me a den of my own."</p>

<p>"And Godfrey?"</p>

<p>"He's very cheerful, with his walks and his books&mdash;and,
as I say, with Margaret."</p>

<p>"You're looking very thoughtful, Arthur. What are you
thinking of? Do you think me wrong about Margaret? I
shall hear of her, you know. I shall know how she's getting
on; Judith will tell me&mdash;and Esther. You can too."</p>

<p>"It's all so strange!" he broke out. "The way you've
just&mdash;vanished! And yet the house goes on!"</p>

<p>She nodded. "And goes on pretty well?" she hazarded,
with raised brows and a little smile. He made a restless
impatient gesture, but did not refuse assent. "Well, if
there's anything to be said for me, there it is! Because it
means that I was a failure."</p>

<p>"You weren't the only failure, Bernadette."</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't. It was all a failure&mdash;all round&mdash;except
you; you got on with all of us. Well, when things are like
that, and then somebody comes and&mdash;and shows you something
quite different, and makes&mdash;yes, makes&mdash;you look at
it&mdash;well, when once you do, you can't look at anything else.
It swallows up everything."</p>

<p>She fell into silence. Arthur moved from the mantelpiece,
and sat down in a chair by her side, whence he watched
her delicate profile as she gazed into the fire thoughtfully.
He waited for her to go on&mdash;to take up the story from the
day when the long failure came to its violent end, from the
morning of her flight.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I could have done anything different; I
don't see it now any more than I saw it then. You won't
forgive Oliver, I suppose&mdash;my old Sir Oliver! In fact, if I
know you, Cousin Arthur, you've been trying to paint him
blacker in the hope of making me whiter! But he gives me a
wonderful life. I never really knew what a man could do for
a woman's life before. Well, I'd had no chance of understanding
that, had I? It's not being in love that I mean so
much. After all, I've been in love before&mdash;yes, and with
Godfrey, as I told you once. And Oliver's not an angel, of
course&mdash;about as far from it as a man could be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should think so," Arthur remarked drily.</p>

<p>She smiled at him. "But there's a sort of largeness about
him, about the way he feels as well as the things he goes in
for. And then his courage! Oh, but I daresay you don't
want to hear me talk about him. I really came only to talk
about Margaret."</p>

<p>"You must know I'm glad to hear you're happy."</p>

<p>She caught a tone of constraint in his voice; the words
sounded almost formal. "Yes, I suppose you are&mdash;and
ready to let it go at that?" she asked quickly, with a little
resentment.</p>

<p>"What else can I do&mdash;or say?" he answered, slowly and
with a puzzled frown. "I've got nothing more to do with it.
I really belong to&mdash;to what you've left behind you. I made a
queer mess of my part of it, but still I did belong there. I
don't belong to this new life of yours, do I?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "No, I suppose you don't.
You belong to Hilsey? Is that it? And I'm trying to get
you on my side&mdash;unfairly?" She challenged him now with
something like anger.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's not a question of sides! I tried not to take sides.
The thing went too deep for that. And why must I, why
should I? But there's what's happened&mdash;the state of
things, you see."</p>

<p>"And the state of things makes you belong to Hilsey,
and prevents your having anything to do with me?"</p>

<p>"That's putting it too strongly&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you mean it comes to that?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"I don't see how, in practice, it can work out very differently
from that."</p>

<p>His voice was low and gentle; he avoided her eyes as he
spoke, though he knew they were upon him, watching him
closely. He had come to this curious searching talk&mdash;or
rather it had come upon him&mdash;totally unprepared. She had
not been much in his thoughts lately; when he had thought
of her, it had been in relation to the past, or to the household
at Hilsey. Her present and future life had been remote,
out of his ken, perhaps relegated to neglect by an instinctive
repugnance, by a latent but surviving jealousy. Now he was
faced with it, without time to consider, to get a clear view&mdash;much
less to find diplomatic or dexterous phrases. If he
were to say anything in reply to the questions with which
Bernadette pressed him&mdash;and he could hardly be dumb&mdash;there
was nothing for it but to give her bluntly what he
thought, his raw reading of the position as it stood, the best
he could make of it on the spur of the moment, without
looking far forward, or anticipating future modifications and
weighing the possible effect of them, and without going into
any of the ethics of the case, without moral judgments or
a casuistry nicely balancing the rights and wrongs of it; all
that seemed futile, arrogant, not for him anyhow. The real
present question was how the state of affairs which had
come into being affected him in regard to Bernadette, what
it left open to them. It was on that point that her questions
pressed him so closely and sharply.</p>

<p>What did she expect? A resumption of her empire over
him? That the idol should be re-erected in the shrine,
pieced together again and put in place to receive its worship?
Then she could not understand all that had gone to the making
and the adoration of it. The flight had brought mighty
changes in and for her&mdash;had she not herself said so? In and
for him was it to make none? She could hardly expect or
claim that. Yet her questions, her resentment, a forlorn
pettishness which had crept into her voice and manner,
suggested that she was feeling hardly used, that she was
disappointed and in some measure affronted by his attitude.
She seemed to pit herself against Hilsey&mdash;against the household
and the home she had elected to leave, for reasons good
or bad, under impulses whether irresistible or merely wayward&mdash;to
pit herself against it with something like scorn, even
with jealousy. Had she not herself been all in all to him at
Hilsey? Had it not been to him a setting for her charm
and fascination, dear to him for her sake? The others there&mdash;what
had they been to him? Oh, friends, yes, friends
and kinsfolk, of course! But essentially, in his real thoughts,
her attendants, her satellites&mdash;and largely the grievances
against which his adoration had protested.</p>

<p>She remembered their last interview, the night before she
went away&mdash;Arthur's despair, his sudden flare of hot passion,
even the words in which he told her that she had been everything,
nearly everything, in his life. Discount them as she
might, calling them a boy's madness and self-delusion, how
they had moved her even at that crisis of her life! They had
smitten her with tender grief, and remained her last impression
of her generous young devotee. She did not want
to hear them again, nor to find that folly still in his heart.
But they had been a witness to her power over him. Was
it lost? What had destroyed it? Her flight with Oliver?
That would be natural and intelligible, and was true in part,
no doubt; nor did she complain of it. But it did not seem
to be what was deepest in his mind, not the real stumbling-block.
If it were a question of personal jealousy and a lover's
disenchantment only, how came Hilsey into the matter?
And it seemed that it was over Hilsey that they had come
to an issue.</p>

<p>She sat a long while, brooding over his last answer, with
her eyes still set on his averted face.</p>

<p>"You mean it'll work out that you're part of the family,
and I'm not? Are you going to cut me, Arthur?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" he cried, turning to her now. "It's
monstrous of you to say that! God knows I've no grudge
against you! I've owed you too much happiness and&mdash;and
felt too much for you. And if we must talk of sides, wasn't
I always on your side?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but now you're not."</p>

<p>"I'm not against you&mdash;indeed I'm not! But if you're
away somewhere with&mdash;well, I mean, away from us, and we're
all together at home&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Us! We! Home!" she repeated after him, with a
smile of rather sad mockery. "Yes, I suppose I begin to see,
Arthur."</p>

<p>"They've made it home to me&mdash;especially since my
mother's death."</p>

<p>Her resentment passed away. She seemed tranquil now,
but sad and regretful. "Yes, I suppose that's the way it'll
work," she said. "I shall get farther and farther off, and
they'll get nearer and nearer!" She laid her hand on his
for a moment, with one of her old light affectionate caresses.
"I was silly enough to think that I could keep you, Arthur,
somehow, in spite of all that's happened. And I wanted to.
Because I'm very fond of you. But I suppose I can't. I'm
a spoilt child&mdash;to think I could have you as well as all the
rest I've got!" She smiled. "Awfully thorough life is,
isn't it? Always making you go the whole hog when you
think you can go half-way, just comfortably half-way! I
don't like it, Cousin Arthur."</p>

<p>"I don't like it either, altogether; but that is the kind
of way it gets you," he agreed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Still we can be good friends," she said, and then broke
away from the conventional words with a quick impatience.
"Oh, being good friends is such a different thing from being
really friends, though!" She took up her gloves and began
to put them on slowly. "I had a letter from Judith just
before I came over," she remarked. "She writes every
three or four weeks, you know. She said you were down
there, and that she and you were having a good time
skating."</p>

<p>"Yes, awfully jolly. She's a champion, you know!"</p>

<p>Bernadette was busy with her gloves. She did not see
the sudden lighting-up of his eyes, as her words recalled to
him the vision of Judith skating, the vivid grace of motion
and the triumph of activity, there on the ice down at Hilsey.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, she's been to Switzerland in the winter a lot,"
said Bernadette carelessly. "I suppose she'd have gone this
year, if it hadn't been for&mdash;" She raised her eyes again to
his, and stopped with a glove half-way on. "Well, if it
hadn't been for me, really!" She smiled, and jerked her head
impatiently. "How I seem to come in everywhere, don't
I? Well, I can't help it! She's got no one else belonging
to her, and she used to be a lot with us anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't worry about her; she's quite happy,"
said Arthur confidently.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I was worrying, though I daresay I
ought to have been. But she likes being there. I expect
she'll settle down there for good and all." As she went back
to her glove-buttoning she added, by way of an after-thought,
"Unless she marries."</p>

<p>Knowing the thing that was taking shape in his own heart,
and reading his own thoughts into the mind of another, as
people are prone to do, Arthur expected here a certain suggestion,
was wondering how to meet it, and was in a way
afraid of it. He felt a sense of surprise when Bernadette
passed directly away from the subject, leaving her after-thought
to assume the form of a merely perfunctory recognition
of the fact that Judith was a girl of marriageable age
and therefore might marry&mdash;perhaps with the implication
that she was not particularly likely to, however. He was
relieved, but somehow a little indignant.</p>

<p>"You've told me hardly anything about yourself," said
Bernadette. But here again the tone sounded perfunctory,
as though the topic she suggested were rather one about
which she ought to inquire than one in which she felt a
genuine interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's not much to tell. I've sown my wild oats,
and now I've settled down to work."</p>

<p>She seemed content with the answer, whose meagreness
responded sensitively to her own want of a true concern.
She was not really interested, he felt, in any life that he
might be living apart from her. She was very fond of him,
as she said and he believed; but it was fondness, a liking
for his company, an enjoyment of him, a desire to have him
about her, had such a thing been still possible; it was not
such a love or deep affection as would make his doings or his
fortunes in themselves of great importance to her. Where
his life was not in actual contact with her own, it did not
touch her feelings deeply. Well, she had always been rather
like that, taking what she wanted of his life and time, leaving
the rest, and paying with her smiles. Well paid too, he had
thought himself, and had made no complaint.</p>

<p>He did not complain now either. He had never advanced
any claim to more than her free grace bestowed; and what
she gave had been to him great. But he felt a contrast. At
home&mdash;his thoughts readily used that word now&mdash;his fortunes
were matter for eager inquiry, excited canvass and speculation.
His meagre answer would not have sufficed there.
Judith and little Margaret had to hear about everything;
even old Godfrey fussed about in easy earshot and listened
furtively. It was not that Bernadette had changed; there
was no reason to blame her, or call her selfish or self-centred.
It was the others who had changed towards him, and he
towards them, and he in himself. For Bernadette he was
still what he had been before the flight&mdash;what Judith had
once called a toy, though a very cherished one. To himself
he seemed to have found, since then, not only a home but a
life.</p>

<p>She did not know that; she had not seen it happening.
Nobody had told her; probably she would not understand
if anyone did&mdash;not even if he himself tried to; and the task
would be difficult and ungracious. And of what use? It
would seem like blame, though he intended none, and against
blame she was very sensitive. It might make her unhappy&mdash;for
she was very fond of him&mdash;and what purpose was served
by marring ever so little a happiness which, whatever else
it might or might not be, was at least hard-won?</p>

<p>She rose. "It must be getting late," she said, "and I'm
going to the theatre. And back to Paris to-morrow! I shan't
be in London again for a long long while. Well, you'll remember
what to tell Godfrey&mdash;how I feel about Margaret?
And&mdash;and anything kind about himself&mdash;if you think he'd
like it."</p>

<p>"I don't really think I'd better risk that."</p>

<p>She smiled. "No, I suppose not. I'm never mentioned&mdash;is
that it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Judith and I talk about you."</p>

<p>"I daresay Judith is very&mdash;caustic?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly. Not nearly so caustic as when you were
with us!"</p>

<p>"Us! Us! I begin to feel as if I'd run away from you
too, Arthur! Though I wasn't your wife, or your mother&mdash;or
even your chaperon, was I? Well, at the end I did run
away a little sooner because of you&mdash;you'd found me out!&mdash;but
I don't think I meant to run away from you for ever.
But you belong to Hilsey now&mdash;so it seems as if it was for
ever. I ran away for ever from Hilsey, all Hilsey&mdash;and now
you're part of it!"</p>

<p>She was standing opposite to him, with a smile that seemed
half to tease him, half to deride herself. She did not seek to
hide her sorrow and vexation at losing him; she hardly
pretended not to be jealous&mdash;he could think her jealous if
he liked! Her old sincerity abode with her; she had no
tricks.</p>

<p>She looked very charming in his eyes; her sorrow at losing
her&mdash;he did not know what to call it, but whatever it was that
she used to get from his society and his adoration&mdash;touched
him profoundly. He took one of her gloved hands and raised
it to his lips. She looked up at him; her eyes were dim.</p>

<p>"It's turned out rather harder in some ways than I thought
it would&mdash;making quite a fresh start, I mean. I do miss the
old things and the old friends dreadfully. But it's worth it.
It was the only thing for me. There was nothing else left to
do. I had to do it."</p>

<p>"You're the only judge," he said gently. "Thank God
it's turned out right for you!"</p>

<p>She smiled under her dim eyes. "Did you think I should
repent? Like those frogs&mdash;you remember?&mdash;in the fable.
King Stork instead of King Log?" She laughed. "It's
not like that." She paused a moment. "And Oliver and I
aren't to be alone together, I think, Cousin Arthur."</p>

<p>He sought for words, but she put her slim fingers lightly
on his lips. "Hush! I don't want to cry. Take me to a
taxi&mdash;Quickly!"</p>

<p>She spoke no more to him&mdash;nor he to her, save to whisper,
with a last clasp of her hand before she drove away, "God
bless you!"</p>

<h2>IN THE SPRING</h2>


<p>Yes, it was all true! The events of that Red Letter
Day had really happened. When Arthur awoke the
next morning, he had a queer feeling of its all being
a dream, a mirage born of ambition. No. The morning
paper proved it; a glance at his own table added confirmation.</p>

<p>Revolving Time had brought round the Easter vacation
again. The last case heard in the Court of Appeal that
sittings was <i>Crewdson v. The Great Southern Railway Company</i>,
on appeal from Knaresby, <span class="smcap">j.</span>'s, judgment on the findings of the
jury. (The subsequent history of the great Dog Case lay
still in the future.) It was a time of political excitement;
Sir Humphrey Fynes, <span class="smcap">k.c.</span>, <span class="smcap">m.p.</span>, had chanced the case being
reached, and gone off to rouse the country to a proper sense
of its imminent peril if the Government continued so much
as a day longer in office. Consequently he was not there to
argue Miss Crewdson's case. Mr. Tracy Darton, <span class="smcap">k.c.</span>, was
there, but he was also in the fashionable divorce case of
the moment, and had to address the jury on the respondent's
behalf. He cut his argument before the Court of Appeal
suspiciously short, and left to his learned friend Mr. Lisle the
task of citing authorities bearing on tricky points relating to
the subject of Common Carriers. Arthur was in a tremor
when he rose&mdash;nearly as much frightened as he had been
before Lance and Pretyman, <span class="smcap">jj.</span>, a year ago&mdash;but his whole
heart was with his dog; he grew excited, he stuck to his guns;
they should have those authorities if he died for it! He was
very tenacious&mdash;and in the end rather long perhaps. But
the Court listened attentively, smiling now and then at his
youthful ardour, but letting him make his points. When
they came to give judgment against his contention, they went
out of the way to compliment him. The Master of the Rolls
said the Court was indebted to Mr. Lisle for his able argument.
Leonard, <span class="smcap">l.j.</span>, confessed that he had been for a moment
shaken by Mr. Lisle's ingenious argument. Pratt, <span class="smcap">l.j.</span>,
quite agreed with what had fallen from My Lord and his
learned Brother concerning Mr. Lisle's conduct of his case.
Even Miss Crewdson herself, whose face had been black as
thunder at Sir Humphrey's desertion and Mr. Darton's
unseemly brevity, and whose shoulders had shrugged scornfully
when Arthur rose, found a smile for him in the hour of
temporary defeat; that she would lose in the end never
entered the indomitable woman's head. Then&mdash;out in the
corridor, when all was over&mdash;Tom Mayne patted him on the
back, and almost danced round him for joy and pride&mdash;it
was impossible to recognise in him the melancholy Mr.
Beverley&mdash;Norton Ward, hurrying off to another case, called
out, "Confound your cheek!" and, to crown all, the august
solicitor of the Great Southern Railway Company, his redoubtable
opponents, gave him a friendly nod, saying, "I was
afraid you were going to turn 'em at the last moment, Mr.
Lisle!" That his appreciation was genuine Arthur's table
proved. There, newly deposited by triumphant Henry, lay
a case to advise the Great Southern Railway Company itself.</p>

<p>"Once you get in with them, sir&mdash;&mdash;!" Henry had said,
rubbing his hands together and leaving the rest to the
imagination.</p>

<p>Such things come seldom to any man, but once or twice in
their careers to many. They came to Arthur as the crown of a
term's hard work, mostly over Norton Ward's briefs&mdash;for
Norton Ward had come to rely on him now and kept him
busy 'devilling'&mdash;but with some little things of his own
too; for Wills and Mayne were faithful, and another firm
had sent a case also. His neck was well in the collar; his
fee book had become more than a merely ornamental appurtenance.
Long and hard, dry and dusty, was the road ahead.
Never mind! His feet were on it, and if he walked warily he
need fear no fatal slip. Letting the case to advise wait&mdash;his
opinion would not be needed before the latter part of the
vacation, Henry said&mdash;he sat in his chair, smoking and
indulging in pardonably rosy reflections.</p>

<p>"Rather different from what it was this time last year!"
said Honest Pride with a chuckle.</p>

<p>A good many things had been rather different with him a
year ago, he might have been cynically reminded; for
instance the last Easter vacation he had dedicated to Miss
Marie Sarradet, and he was not dedicating this coming one
to Mrs. Sidney Barslow; and other things, unknown a year
ago, had figured on the moving picture of his life, and said
their say to him, and gone their way. But to-day he was
looking forward and not back, seeing beginnings, not endings,
not burying the past with tears or smiles, but hailing the
future with a cheery cry of welcome for its hazards and its
joys.</p>

<p>Henry put his head in at the door. "Sir Christopher
Lance has rung up, sir, and wants to know if you'll lunch
with him to-day at one-thirty&mdash;at his house."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. Say, with pleasure." Left alone again,
Arthur ejaculated "Splendid!" Sir Christopher had seen
the report in the paper! He read the law reports, of course.
A thought crossed Arthur's mind&mdash;would they read the law
reports at Hilsey? They might not have kept their eye on
his case. He folded up the paper and put it carefully in the
little bag which he was now in the habit of carrying to and
fro between his lodgings and his chambers.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher was jubilant over the report. "A feather
in your cap to get that out of Leonard&mdash;a crusty old dog, but
a deuced fine lawyer!" he said. But the news of the case
from the Great Southern Railway Company meant yet more
to him. "If they take you up, they can see you through,
Arthur."</p>

<p>"If I don't make a fool of myself," Arthur put in.</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll expect you to do that once or twice. Don't
be frightened. The dog of yours is a lucky dog, eh? All
you've got to do now is to take things quietly, and not fret.
Remember that only one side can win, and it's not to be
expected that you'll be on the right side always. I think
you'll be done over the dog even, in the end, you know."</p>

<p>"Not I!" cried Arthur indignantly. "That Harrogate
cur's not our dog, sir."</p>

<p>"Human justice is fallible," laughed the old man. "Anyhow
it's a good sporting case. And what are you going to do
with yourself now?"</p>

<p>"I'm off to Hilsey for a fortnight's holiday. Going at
four o'clock."</p>

<p>"Losing no time," Sir Christopher remarked with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, it's jolly in the country in the spring, isn't it?"
Arthur asked, rather defensively.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's jolly in the spring&mdash;jolly anywhere in the spring,
Arthur."</p>

<p>Arthur caught the kindly banter in his tone; he flushed a
little and smiled in answer. "It was very jolly there in the
winter too, if you come to that, sir. Ripping skating!"</p>

<p>"Does all the family skate?"</p>

<p>"No, not all the family." He laughed. "Just enough
of it, Sir Christopher."</p>

<p>The old man sat back in his chair and sipped his hock.
"Some men can get on without a woman about them but,
so far as I've observed you, I don't think you're that sort.
If you must have a woman about you, there's a good deal
to be said for its being your own wife, and not, as so often
happens, somebody else's. May we include that among our
recent discoveries?"</p>

<p>"But your own wife costs such a lot of money."</p>

<p>"So do the others&mdash;very often. Don't wait too long for
money, or for too much of it. Things are jolliest in the
spring!"</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm rather young. I'm only twenty-five, you
know."</p>

<p>"And a damned good age for making love too!" Sir
Christopher pronounced emphatically.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, if that's your experience, sir!" laughed
Arthur.</p>

<p>Sir Christopher grew graver. "Does the wound heal at
Hilsey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so&mdash;slowly."</p>

<p>"Surgery's the only thing sometimes; when you can't
cure, you must cut. At any rate we won't think hardly of
our beautiful friend. I don't believe, though, that you're
thinking of her at all, you young rascal! You're thinking
of nothing but that train at four o'clock."</p>

<p>Arthur was silent a moment or two. "I daresay that
some day, when it's a bit farther off, I shall be able to look
at it all better&mdash;to see just what happened and what it came
to. But I can't do that now. I&mdash;I haven't time." They had
finished lunch. He came and rested his hand on the old
man's shoulder. "At any rate, it's brought me your friendship.
I can't begin to tell you what that is to me, sir."</p>

<p>Sir Christopher looked up at him. "I can tell you what it
is to me, though. It's a son for my barren old age&mdash;and I'm
quite ready to take a daughter too, Arthur."</p>

<p>Arthur went off by the four o'clock train, with his copy of
<i>The Times</i> in his pocket. But out of that pocket it never
emerged, save in the privacy of his den, and there it was
hidden carefully. Never in all his life did he confess that he
had "happened" to bring it down with him. For, on the
platform at Hilsey, the first thing he saw was Judith waiting
for him. As soon as he put his head out of the window, she
ran towards him, brandishing <i>The Times</i> in her hand. No
motive to produce his copy, no need to confess that he had
brought it!</p>

<p>His attitude towards Judith's copy was one of apparent
indifference. It could not be maintained in face of her
excitement and curiosity. The report seemed to have had
on her much the same effect as skating. She proposed to
walk home, and let the car take his luggage, and, as soon
as they were clear of the station, she cried, "Now you've got
to tell me all&mdash;all&mdash;about it! What are the Rolls, and who's
the Master of them? What's Lord Justice Leonard like?
And the other one&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;Pratt? And what
was it in your speech that they thought so clever?"</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you wouldn't see it," said Arthur,
not mentioning that he had taken his own measures to meet
that contingency, had it arisen.</p>

<p>"Not see it! Why, I hunt all through those wretched
cases every morning of my life, looking for that blessed dog
of yours! So I shall, till it's found, or buried, or something.
Now begin at the beginning, and tell me just how everything
happened."</p>

<p>"I say, this isn't the shortest way home, you know."</p>

<p>"I know it isn't. Begin now directly, Arthur." She had
hold of his arm now, <i>The Times</i> still in her other hand.
"Godfrey's quite excited too&mdash;for him. He'd have come,
only he's got a bad cold; and Margaret stayed to comfort
him. Begin now!"</p>

<p>His attitude of indifference had no chance. All the story
was dragged from him by reiterated "And thens&mdash;?"
He warmed to it himself, working up through their lordships,
through Miss Crewdson's smile ("She looks an
uncommonly nice old girl," he interjected), through Tom
Mayne's raptures and Norton Ward's jocose tribute, to the
climax of the august solicitor and the case to advise which
attested his approval. "That may mean a lot to me,"
Arthur ended.</p>

<p>"The people you'd been trying to beat!" Her voice
sounded awed at the wonder of it. "I should have thought
they'd just hate you. I wish I was a man, Arthur! Aren't
you awfully proud of it all?"</p>

<p>Well, he was awfully proud, there was no denying it. "I
wish the dear old mater could have read it!"</p>

<p>She pressed his arm. "We can read it. I've helped
Margaret to spell it out. She's feeling rather afraid of you,
now that you've got your name in the paper. And Godfrey's
been looking up all the famous Lisles in the County History!
You won't have to be doing Frank Norton Ward's work for
him now all the time&mdash;and for nothing too!"</p>

<p>In vain he tried to tell her how valuable the devilling was
to him. No, she thought it dull, and was inclined to lay stress
on the way Norton Ward found his account in it. Arthur
gave up the effort, but, somewhat alarmed by the expectations
he seemed to be raising, ventured to add, "Don't think
I'm going to jump into five thousand a year, Judith!"</p>

<p>"Let me have my little crow out, and then I'll be sensible
about it," she pleaded.</p>

<p>But he did not in his heart want her sensible; her eyes
would not be so bright, nor her cheeks glow with colour; her
voice would not vibrate with eager joyfulness, nor her laugh
ring so merrily; infectious as Miss Ayesha Layard's own, it
was really! Small wonder that he caught the infection of
her sanguine pleasure too. Long roads seemed short that
evening, whether they led to fame and fortune, or only
through the meadows and across the river to Hilsey Manor.</p>

<p>"Now the others will want to hear all about it," said Judith,
with something like a touch of jealousy.</p>

<p>The story had to be told again&mdash;this time with humorous
magniloquence for Margaret's benefit, with much stress on
their lordships' wigs and gowns, a colourable imitation of
their tones and manner, and a hint of the awful things they
might have done to Arthur if he had displeased them&mdash;which
Margaret, with notions of a trial based on <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
was quite prepared to believe. Godfrey shuffled about within
earshot, his carpet slippers (his cold gave good excuse for them)
padding up and down the room as he listened without seeming
to listen, and his shy, "Very&mdash;very&mdash;er&mdash;satisfactory to you,
Arthur!" coming with a pathetic inadequacy at the end of
the recital.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;before dinner&mdash;a quiet half-hour in his own den
upstairs, where everything was ready for him and seemed to
expect him, where fresh fragrant flowers on table and chimney-piece
revealed affectionate anticipation of his coming, where
the breeze blew in, laden with the sweetness of spring, through
the open windows. As he sat by them, he could hear the
distant cawing of the rooks and see the cattle grazing in the
meadows. The river glinted under the setting sun, the wood
on the hill stood solid and sombre with clear-cut outline. The
Peace of God seemed to rest on the old place and to wrap it
round in a golden tranquillity. His heart was in a mood
sensitive to the suggestion. He rested after his labours, after
the joyful excitement of the last twenty-four hours. So Hilsey
too seemed to rest after its struggle, and to raise in kind
security the head that had bent before the storm.</p>

<p>He had left his door ajar and had not heard anyone enter.
But presently&mdash;it may be that he had fallen into a doze, or
a state of passive contemplation very like one&mdash;he found
Judith standing by the arm-chair in which he was reclining&mdash;oh,
so lazily and pleasantly! She looked as if she might have
been there for some little while, some few moments at all
events, and she was gazing out on the fairness of the evening
with a smile on her lips.</p>

<p>"I've been putting Margaret to bed&mdash;she was allowed an
extra hour in your honour&mdash;and then I just looked in here to
see if you wanted anything."</p>

<p>"I shall make a point of wanting as many things as I
possibly can. I love being waited on, and I've never been able
to get enough of it. I shall keep you busy! Judith, to think
that I was once going to desert Hilsey! Well, I suppose we
shall be turned out some day." He sighed lightly and humorously
over the distant prospect of ejection by Margaret, grown-up,
married perhaps, and the <i>chÃ¢telaine</i>.</p>

<p>"If you want to know your future, I happen to be able to
tell you," said Judith. "Margaret arranged it while she was
getting into bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, let's hear this! It's important&mdash;most important!"
he cried, sitting up.</p>

<p>"If you don't want to go on living here, you're to have a
house built for you up on the hill there. On the other side of
the wood, I insisted; otherwise you'd spoil the view horribly!
But Margaret didn't seem to mind about that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I must be behind the wood&mdash;especially if I'm
to have a modern artistic cottage."</p>

<p>"There you're to live&mdash;when you're not in London, being
praised by judges&mdash;and you're to come down the hill to tea
every day of the week."</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem a bad idea&mdash;only she might sometimes
make it dinner!"</p>

<p>"She'll make it dinner when she's bigger, I daresay. At
present, for her, you see, dinner doesn't count."</p>

<p>"Why does she think I mightn't want to go on living here?
Is she contemplating developments in my life? Or in her own?
And where are you going to live while I'm living on the top of
the hill, out of sight behind the wood? Did Margaret settle
your future too, Judith?"</p>

<p>"I don't think it occurs to her that I've got one&mdash;except
just to go on being here. We women&mdash;we ordinary women&mdash;get
our futures settled for us. I think Bernadette settled mine
the day she ran away and left poor Hilsey derelict."</p>

<p>He looked up at her with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.
"Should you put the settling of your fate quite as early as that,
Judith?"</p>

<p>She saw what he meant and shook her head at him in
reproof, but her eyes were merry and happy.</p>

<p>"Have you thought over that idea of Switzerland in the
winter?"</p>

<p>"It's the spring now. Why do you want to think of
winter?"</p>

<p>"The thought of winter makes the spring even pleasanter."
She smiled as she rested her hand on his shoulder and looked
down on his face. "Well, perhaps&mdash;if I can possibly persuade
Godfrey to come with us."</p>

<p>"If he won't? What are we to do if we can get nobody to
go with us?"</p>

<p>She broke into a low gentle laugh. "Well, I don't want to
get rusty in my skating. And it's splendid over there." Her
eyes met his for a moment in gleeful confession. "Still&mdash;the
best day's skating I ever had in my life, Arthur, was the first
day we skated here at Hilsey."</p>

<p class='ft110'><b>VICTORY. By Joseph Conrad,</b> Author of 'Chance.'</p>

<p>In this story Mr. Conrad returns to the manner of his famous early romance,
<i>The Outcast of the Island</i>. The principal character, a lawless adventurer called
'Enchanted Heyst,' is one of the great figures in Mr. Conrad's gallery; the scene
is laid in and about the tropical island of Samburan; and the theme is love and
jealousy.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>BEALBY. By H. G. Wells.</b></p>

<p>This new novel is a feast of fast and furious fun. Mr. Wells throws problems
of all sorts to the dogs, and revels in the diverting adventures of a small boy who,
in the course of one brief week, works havoc in the lives of many people.
Delightful people are they all, as portrayed by Mr. Wells, from the self-important,
philosophic Lord Chancellor down to the socialistic (and very dirty)
tramp.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>A GREAT MAN. By Arnold Bennett,</b> Author of 'Clayhanger.'</p>

<p>This is a new edition of a well-known novel by Mr. Arnold Bennett, called
by him a 'frolic.' It may be said to have paved the way for his famous comic
romance <i>The Card</i> and its sequel <i>The Regent</i>. In <i>A Great Man</i> Mr. Bennett
describes the life and achievements of Henry Shakespeare Knight, who from
humble beginnings becomes a world-famous novelist and one of the wealthiest
of playwrights, a goal attained only after much amusing adventure by the way.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>A YOUNG MAN'S YEAR. By Anthony Hope.</b></p>

<p>The story of an eventful year in the life of Arthur Lisle, of the Middle Temple,
Esquire: recounting his fortunes and ventures, professional, speculative, and
romantic, and showing how he sought without finding, and found without seeking,
and, at the end of the year, was twelve months older and as much wiser as young
men are for such experiences.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>SECRET HISTORY. By C. N. and A. M. Williamson,</b>
Authors of 'The Lightning Conductor.'</p>

<p>The title of this book refers to the 'secret history' of a recent critical episode
between the United States and Mexico. Taking the form of the dramatic and
sensational love stories of two Irish girls and two officers, the romance has its
scenes partly at an army post in Texas and partly in diplomatic circles in London
in 1914-15. The story is told in the first person by Lady Peggy O'Malley.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>GOSSAMER. By George A. Birmingham,</b> Author of
'Spanish Gold.'</p>

<p>In this book the principal characters are a leader in the world of international
finance, an Irish country gentleman who has parted with his estate, an Irish
journalist who is also a member of Parliament attached to the Nationalist party,
a lady artist, and an inventor occupied with mechanical devices. The story ends
with the declaration of war in August 1914, and culminates in the effect of that
catastrophe on the lives and fortunes of the various characters.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS. By Marjorie Bowen.</b></p>

<p>This story relates the inevitable tragic drama of the reckless union of
two diverse temperaments and races, brought together by a useless passion.
The scene changes from Bologna, the most dissipated city of Italy, to the
Calvinistic gloom of Scotland.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>THE RAINBOW. By D. H. Lawrence,</b> Author of 'Sons and
Lovers.'</p>

<p>This story, by one of the most remarkable of the younger school of novelists,
contains a history of the Brangwen character through its developing crisis of
love, religion, and social passion, from the time when Tom Brangwen, the well-to-do
Derbyshire farmer, marries a Polish lady, to the moment when Ursula, his
granddaughter, the leading-shoot of the restless, fearless family, stands waiting
at the advance-post of our time to blaze a path into the future.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>DAVID PENSTEPHEN. By Richard Pryce,</b> Author of
'Christopher.'</p>

<p>The author deals with the early years of a boy's life. The action of the story,
opening abroad, and then moving to London and to English country houses,
takes place in the seventies. The story is almost as much the story of David's
mother as of David himself, and shows, against a background of the manners of
the time, the consequences of a breaking away from the established order. How,
under the shadow, David's childhood is yet almost wholly happy, and how on the
threshold of manhood he is left ready&mdash;his heart's desire in view&mdash;to face life in
earnest and to make a new name for himself in his own way, these pages tell.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>THE KENNEDY PEOPLE. By W. Pett Ridge,</b> Author of
'The Happy Recruit.'</p>

<p>The author is, in this novel, still faithful to London, but he sets out here to
till something like fresh ground. A description is given of three generations of a
family, and particulars are conveyed of the kind of chart that represented their
advances and their retreats. The story is told in Mr. Pett Ridge's lively and
characteristic manner.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>Mr. GREX OF MONTE CARLO. By E. Phillips Oppenheim,</b>
Author of 'Master of Men.'</p>

<p>Mr. Oppenheim has never written a more absorbing story than this one, in
which an adventurous young American first falls in love, then into trouble, and
becomes a part of events that are making history.</p>

<p>In Monte Carlo three men skilled in international intrigue meet in secret
conference; two Ministers of foreign affairs and a Grand Duke plan to make over
the map of Europe, while a diplomat representing a fourth great world-power,
aided by skilled secret-service men, aims to thwart their endeavours. Then&mdash;enter
the American. How young Richard Lane, wealthy and used to having his
own way, fell in love with mysterious Mr. Grex's daughter, how he was not discouraged
even when he found out what an important personage Mr. Grex really
was, how he took a hand in events and caused an upset, is told in a thrilling
love story that lays bare the methods of modern international diplomatists and
incidentally conveys a warning to America to arm herself against the possibilities
of war.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>THE EVIL DAY. By Lady Troubridge.</b></p>

<p>In this book Lady Troubridge abandons for the first time the study of the very
young girl, to give us one of a woman of forty, who, until the story opens, has
led a quiet, retired and domestic existence. Circumstances, however, bring the
heroine face to face with modern life and its developments in their most vivid
form, and she does not pass through the experience altogether unscathed.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>THE SECRET SON. By Mrs. Henry Dudeney.</b></p>

<p>Mrs. Henry Dudeney's new novel is a delightful story of the Sussex Downs.
Its types and characters are rustic, and in it comedy and tragedy are skilfully
mingled by this most accomplished writer. The theme of the book is the relation
between mother and son, and the reader passes to the close of a very human
story with a most absorbing interest.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>DEMI-ROYAL. By Ashton Hilliers,</b> Author of 'The Adventures
of a Lady of Quality.'</p>

<p>That the famous Mrs. Fitzherbert, legal and loyal wife of the Regent, <i>may</i>
have borne him a child is indisputable. That she did so is the author's thesis in
this diverting romance; and the fortunes of this child, legitimate, but un-royal,
trepanned, lost, mourned as dead, repudiated, traced, acknowledged, are his
theme. The mother-love of a noble woman, the fears of a selfish voluptuary,
the self-sacrifice of honest York, form the warp across which runs the woof of
a girl's life lived innocently and spiritedly in Puritan surroundings, watched
over by the Order of Jesus, the unconscious centre of vehement antagonisms.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>SOMETHING NEW. By P. G. Wodehouse,</b> Author of 'The
Little Nugget.'</p>

<p>The treatment of this story is farcical, but all the characters are drawn carefully
as if it were a comedy. Ashe Marson, a struggling writer of adventure
stories, sees an advertisement in a paper in which 'a young man of good appearance
who is poor and reckless, is needed for a delicate and perilous enterprise.'
Joan Valentine, the heroine, who has been many things in her time, also answers an
advertisement requiring 'a woman to conduct a delicate and perilous enterprise.'</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>THE HIGHWAYMAN. By H. C. Bailey,</b> Author of 'A
Gentleman Adventurer.'</p>

<p>This is a story set in the last years of Queen Anne. Naturally, Jacobite and
Hanoverian plots and conspirators furnish much of the incident. They are,
however, only a background to the hero and heroine, whose love with its
adventures and misadventures is the main subject of the novel. Though Marlborough
and the Old Pretender, Queen Anne and other figures of history play
their part, it is the hero and heroine who hold the centre of the stage.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>THE YELLOW CLAW. By Sax Rohmer,</b> Author of 'Dr.
Fu-Manchu.'</p>

<p>This is an enthralling tale of Eastern mystery and crime in a European setting.
The action moves from an author's flat in Westminster to the 'Cave of the Golden
Dragon,' Shadwell, and the weird Catacombs below the level of the Thames, and
circles round 'Mr. King,' the sinister and unseen president of the Kan-Suh Opium
Syndicate. We meet with the beautiful Eurasian, MahÃ¢ra, 'Our Lady of the
Poppies,' and are introduced to M. Gaston Max, Europe's greatest criminologist,
and to the beetle-like Chinaman, Ho-Pin.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>THE OCEAN SLEUTH. By Maurice Drake.</b></p>

<p>This is an exciting story, by one of the most promising of the younger novelists,
of perils by sea and criminal hunting by land. The tale begins with some exciting
salvage while off the Cornish coast, and passes on to the allurements of detective
work in England and Brittany. In Austin Voogdt, the hero, Mr. Drake has
created a commanding figure in romance.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>THE PERPETUAL CHOICE. By Constance Cotterell,</b>
Author of 'The Virgin and the Scales.'</p>

<p><i>The Perpetual Choice</i> runs between poverty and wealth, passion and prejudice,
London and the country, and is the story of a high-spirited girl. She has to discover
the precariousness of housekeeping on enthusiasm with her strange friends,
and finds that poverty is partly fun and partly a blight. Three men love her, all
differently, and when she falls in love her crisis has come.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>CHARLES QUANTRILL. By Evelyn Apted.</b></p>

<p>A story of quiet charm and of intense human interest. The interest of the
book does not depend on sensational effects, but rather in the endeavour to apply
insight and imagination to the faithful description of events and problems which
might confront any one of its readers. The scene shifts at times from England
to South Africa, Norway, and the Riviera. A perfectly natural sequence of events
leads to the marriage of a girl of strong character with a man of principles less
high than her own. The writer brings the story to a dramatic close about two
years after the marriage.</p>


<p class='ft110'><b>LITTLE HEARTS. By Marjorie L. Pickthall.</b></p>

<p>A story of the Forest and the Downs in the troubled times of the eighteenth
century, telling how Mr. Sampson, a gentleman engaged in the production of a
Philosophy of Poverty, rescues and shelters one Anthony Oakshott, who is thrown
from horseback over his wall, and whom he takes for an heroic Jacobite, much
wanted by the King's men. By so doing he changes his own life and that of the
girl he loves.</p>
